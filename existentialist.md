# The Existentialist's Surival Guide

## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Chapter One: Anxiety

Emil M. Cioran, Romanian Philosopher, wrote: *"Anxiety is not provoked: it tries to find a justification for itself, and in order to do so seizes upon anything, the vilest pretexts, to which it clings once it has invented them. . . . [A]nxiety provokes itself, engenders itself, it is “infinite creation.”*

Meditation and therapy impact neurochemistry.

For most people anxiety is just a meaningless, disruptive symptom that does not require psychotherapy or even introspection

Spinoza wrote, “Fear arises from a weakness of mind and
therefore does not appertain to the use of reason.”

For Kierkegaard anxiety helps us to know ourselves. It informs us that we are beings who have
choices, who choose ourselves. Kierkegaard describes anxiety as “the dizziness of freedom.” 

Kierkegaard writes: *"Deepest within every person there is nonetheless an anxiety about being alone in the world, forgotten by God,
overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. People keep this anxiety at bay by looking
at the many people around them, who are related to them as family and friend; . . . one scarcely dare think about
how one would feel if all these were taken away"*

Anxiety helps us secure our identities as authentic individuals separate from the crowd

Kieerkegard writes: “Anxiety . . . is an expression of the perfection of human nature. It is the homesickness of earthly life for
the higher.”

If you trust that your task in life is to become an authentic human being, then you will know
what you should truly fear—namely, becoming a vacant-eyed, empty suit of an individual.

Kierkegaard said for those who don't experience anxiety “That is because he is spiritless.”

## Chapter Two: Depression

One in eight Americans are being medicated for depression. 

Kierkegaard says depression “has robbed us of the courage to command, the courage to obey, the power to act, the confidence to hope.”

Psychoanalysts talk about the importance of having an observing ego, a psychological
third eye, a part of the self that keeps watch on the inner workings of your mind.

In Either/Or Kierkegaard writes: "Depression is the most faithful mistress I have known—no wonder, then, that I return the love.”

Despair used to be classified as one of the seven deadly sins, it has now been folded into the concept of clinical depression. Americans seldom distinguish between psychological and spiritual illnesses. 

In Either/Or Kierkegaard writes: "What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music. It is with him as with the poor wretches in
Phalaris’s bronze bull, who were slowly tortured over a slow fire; their screams could not reach the tyrant’s ears to
terrify him; to him they sounded like sweet music"

In 1836, Kiekegaard writes in a journal: "I have just returned from a party of which I was the life and soul; witticisms poured from my lips, everybody laughed and admired me—but I left, yes, the dash should be as long as the radii of the earth’s orbit
—–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––—and wanted to shoot myself."

In Danish, tungsind literally means "heavy-mindedness". 

Kierkegaard writes in Either/Or: "There is something unexplainable in depression [Tungsind]. A person with a sorrow or a worry knows why he sorrows or worries. If a depressed person is asked what the reason is, what it is that weighs [tynge] on him, he will
answer: I do not know; I cannot explain it. Therein lies the limitlessness of depression."

Kierkegaard writes in The Sickness Unto Death: “A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and
the eternal, of freedom and necessity.”. Despair is caused by an imbalance in this. 

You should strive for reaching the moral ideal, as the sort of person you aspire to be, of the kind of individual who reminds you of
what we are capable of.

Kierkegaard: "Happiness is the greatest hiding place for despair"

We might not have much choice in how we feel at a given time, we have control over and responsibility for the way we relate
ourselves to those feelings. 

In "The Loss of Sadness", authors Allan Horwitz and Jerome Wakefield
contend that with the medicalization of just about everything, we have arrived at treating
ordinary sadness as if it were a depressive illness.

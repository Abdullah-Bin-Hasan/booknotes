## Chapter One: Anxiety

Emil M. Cioran, Romanian Philosopher, wrote: *"Anxiety is not provoked: it tries to find a justification for itself, and in order to do so seizes upon anything, the
vilest pretexts, to which it clings once it has invented them. . . . [A]nxiety provokes itself, engenders itself, it is
“infinite creation.”*

Meditation and therapy impact neurochemistry.

For most people anxiety is just a meaningless, disruptive symptom that does not require psychotherapy or even introspection

Spinoza wrote, “Fear arises from a weakness of mind and
therefore does not appertain to the use of reason.”

For Kierkegaard anxiety helps us to know ourselves. It informs us that we are beings who have
choices, who choose ourselves. Kierkegaard describes anxiety as “the dizziness of freedom.” 

Kierkegaard writes: *"Deepest within every person there is nonetheless an anxiety about being alone in the world, forgotten by God,
overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. People keep this anxiety at bay by looking
at the many people around them, who are related to them as family and friend; . . . one scarcely dare think about
how one would feel if all these were taken away"*

Anxiety helps us secure our identities as authentic individuals separate from the crowd

Kieerkegard writes: “Anxiety . . . is an expression of the perfection of human nature. It is the homesickness of earthly life for
the higher.”

## Notes by Christopher Durr

## CHAPTER ONE SELLING—A WAY OF LIFE

The ability to get others to like you, work with you, and want to please you determines how well you will survive.

The truth is, businesses fail first and foremost because their ideas weren’t sold quickly enough and in quantities great enough, and therefore they ran out of money.

A sale is made in every exchange of ideas or communication—there are no exceptions. Deny it if you will, but that won’t change the facts. You’re a salesperson, and you’re one every single day of your life.

Every time you get your way, you’ve just been paid a commission.

Confrontation and pressure are attributes of the amateur who doesn’t understand sales and ends up resorting to unpleasant tactics.

People continue to pass on the false information that selling is hard, that it’s difficult to depend on commissions, that selling is sleazy, that you’ll have to work long hours, that it isn’t a dependable profession, that you can’t rely on the income, and that it’s not considered a “real” job! It’s a shame, because selling as a profession offers a great deal of freedom and numerous financial benefits.

A person’s ability to persuade another is the only thing that will ultimately ensure a position in the marketplace. Academic records, grades, and résumés won’t guarantee you a promotion or advancement in life, but the ability to sell will.

## Chapter 2

A basic education, while very necessary, cannot be considered an “end all.” While there are some great teachers in the school system, it’s unfortunate that due to the ridiculously low salaries, many of them are only regurgitating curriculums and forcing students to study courses and subjects that will never be used in their day-to-day lives.

Every person, no matter what his profession is, relies on selling. The politician wants to appeal to you and your interests so that you’ll vote for him in the polling booth. The public speaker is hoping to convince the audience that his approach is the right one. The employee desiring a promotion will have to sell the boss on his value to the company. 

## Chapter 3

99 percent of all “professional” salespeople have only a slight idea of what selling is, much less how to actually determine and predict results

There are vast shortages of highly committed, highly dedicated, and great salespeople.

## Chapter 4

To the degree that you aren’t proud of the job you’re doing, you won’t be successful; and the degree to which you are successful will determine how proud you are of your career. The career you are in is not the problem—your commitment is the problem

Commitment = Results = Happiness

The ability to predict is the first thing that happens when you become a professional, and when I reached this level of ability, I knew I was on my way to great success.

How does one gain the skill of prediction? You have to start looking at everything that’s happening, observe it accurately without emotion or blame, and make a note of it. The ability to predict comes from assuming responsibility for what’s going on around you and believing you can control it.

The only reason a person doesn’t like what he’s doing is because he doesn’t know what he’s doing

Most salespeople are amateurs, some of them are professionals, and only a few are greats. Ultimately, it comes down to the level of commitment and dedication you have

## Chapter 5

You’ve got to be absolutely convinced that your product, your company, your services, or your ideas are superior to all others.

The conviction that you have regarding your product is more important than the conviction that others have about their facts and figures.

Become so thoroughly sold on your product that your conviction is irresistible to others. 

There’s always been competition and there always will be. The problem isn’t product knowledge, competition, or smarter customers; the real issue is whether or not you are fully sold on your product.

People will follow you to your chiropractor, consult your doctor, hire your maid, or go to the movie you recommended—all because of what you did, not what you said. 

## Chapter 6

Getting the sale isn’t about money; it’s ultimately about the buyer having confidence that the product is the right one.
If there is a price difference, the customer wants assurance that your product has advantages in excess of the cost difference.

If the price gets too cheap, people won’t see any value in the product. 

Always try to move the buyer up to a bigger or more expensive product as the first solution to price objection.

Your prospect is never the problem—never! Salespeople, not the prospect, are the ultimate barriers to every sale.

You have to have a positive outlook about people. You have to believe that people are good and that they want to make the right decision.

## Chapter 7

Get over the idea that there’s a scarcity of money because there isn’t! There’s plenty of money to go around. If you start looking for prosperity and abundance, you’ll see that these things exist all around you.

Second money is easier to get than first money.

Your prospect, regardless of what he says, always wants more, not less. Believe it or not, people love to spend money, and the more money they spend, the more they enjoy spending it and the more they will enjoy their decision

People love showing off.


## Chapter 8

If you don’t show as much interest in the buyer and his concerns as you do in selling, he’ll know that you are only in it for the commission.

People are senior to processes employed by companies. No product or sales process will ever be successful if it doesn’t make people senior!

## Chapter 9 

Try to agree with everyone you talk to for a single day.

Agree and then offer the buyer an opportunity to find the solution before you offer one to find out how much of an objection it actually is.

If you want people to agree with your viewpoint, all you’ve got to do is agree with their position, agree with their opinions, and step into their shoes for a moment.

## Chapter 10

Prospects do not make sales, either. It is the salesperson’s job to make the sale. Whether or not the sale happens is entirely up to the salesperson, not the prospect.

The buyer who says, “I’m not buying today,” is indicating his lack of trust of either salespeople or his ability to make good decisions.

Always assume that the buyer doesn’t trust a single word you say to him. He might not even believe that your name is what you say it is, which is why you need to create something that buyers know they can trust because they can see it. 

Always, always, always write down what you’ve said, offered, proposed, promised, implied, and suggested. Anytime you’re going for the close, insist on putting it in writing.

* Never sell with words. Always show documentation.
* Never negotiate with words. Write your negotiations down on paper.
* Never ask for the close with words. Use a buyer’s order.
* Never make verbal promises. Put all of your assurances in writing.
* The more data you provide, the better. Don’t be afraid to use a lot of data.
* Keep your information current.
* Have your written information available and easy to access.
* Use third-party data as much as possible.
* The more you’re able to access the data in real time, the better. Real-time data are preferable to prepared data.
* Use computer-generated data whenever possible.
* Have Internet access available so you can pull the data up in front of the customer and he can see that it hasn’t been contrived or manipulated.

People believe what they see, not what they hear. So show them, don’t tell them!

## Chapter 11

The true essence of selling is not just getting the sale, but the sincere desire to help. A spiritually aware person will ultimately be a better salesperson than someone who’s just interested in compensation.

Give all of you to a prospect, not just a part of you. Give all of your attention, all of your energy, all of your suggestions, all of your information

Show each customer how important they are to you and how they’re the most important person in your universe. If you can do that you will be rewarded. If you chase two rabbits at the same time, both will get away.

You don’t have to trick or deceive to sell. You have to be willing to serve and help people before you’ll get the close. A buyer will pay extra for great service, a great attitude, ease of purchase, convenience, and being made to feel special. Look at how you can create a level of service that separates you from others. 

Service is always senior to selling—always.

## Chapter 12

Most people will not just give you the money without you asking, persisting, and being willing to “hard sell.”

You’re certain that your service is superior to that of anyone anywhere and ultimately the only right choice your customer can make, and you insist on it because of this belief. Because you believe this so deeply, you’re willing to stay in the deal even when it gets uncomfortable and people are squirming, making excuses, and becoming difficult.

The willingness to stay and persist even when the prospect becomes noisy is what separates the professional, consistent closer from the amateur who randomly closes deals.

The more you practice handling objections, the more natural you’ll sound.

You’ll almost never close a deal if you’re standing up. Sit your clients down and show them what you can do for them.

## Chapter 13

The amount of success you have is limited by the amount of action you take. Stay away from the people who tell you to stop working so hard and suggest that you should relax and take it easy. Go massive, not passive

Doing too much will never fail you, but doing too little always will.

Anyone who tells you that you’re working too hard is not working hard enough. 

Don’t quit until you get new problems—problems like taxes, cars, homes, and where to go on vacation.

Never be reasonable when it comes to taking action. Just take more action. Be almost insane with how much action you take to get the job done.

## Chapter 14

 The easiest sale you’ll ever make in your life is the one to those people who already know you, trust you, and want to help you. Everyone has a power base or a fan club. Don’t ignore it; work it, use it, and mine it like gold.
 
 Your power base includes, but is not limited to, friends, family members, associates at past jobs, past employers, current and former clients, members of clubs, neighbors, members of organizations you belong to, members of your church, and believe it or not, even people who didn’t like you in high school.

it’s easier to sell a past enemy than it is to sell someone you’ve never met. 

Complaints are one of the most overlooked opportunities for additional sales. Problems are opportunities

## Chapter 15

It’s actually a lie when you tell yourself that you don’t have enough time! The fact is, you have the same amount of time as everyone else; you just aren’t using it efficiently.

I made it a firm policy that if I wasn’t eating with clients or potential clients, I’d eat lunch in my office while I called clients.

Going to lunch with your boss will not get you job security, but selling more products will.

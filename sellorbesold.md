# Sell or Be Sold by Grant Cardone
## Notes by Christopher Durr

## CHAPTER ONE SELLING—A WAY OF LIFE

The ability to get others to like you, work with you, and want to please you determines how well you will survive.

The truth is, businesses fail first and foremost because their ideas weren’t sold quickly enough and in quantities great enough, and therefore they ran out of money.

A sale is made in every exchange of ideas or communication—there are no exceptions. Deny it if you will, but that won’t change the facts. You’re a salesperson, and you’re one every single day of your life.

Every time you get your way, you’ve just been paid a commission.

Confrontation and pressure are attributes of the amateur who doesn’t understand sales and ends up resorting to unpleasant tactics.

People continue to pass on the false information that selling is hard, that it’s difficult to depend on commissions, that selling is sleazy, that you’ll have to work long hours, that it isn’t a dependable profession, that you can’t rely on the income, and that it’s not considered a “real” job! It’s a shame, because selling as a profession offers a great deal of freedom and numerous financial benefits.

A person’s ability to persuade another is the only thing that will ultimately ensure a position in the marketplace. Academic records, grades, and résumés won’t guarantee you a promotion or advancement in life, but the ability to sell will.

## Chapter 2

A basic education, while very necessary, cannot be considered an “end all.” While there are some great teachers in the school system, it’s unfortunate that due to the ridiculously low salaries, many of them are only regurgitating curriculums and forcing students to study courses and subjects that will never be used in their day-to-day lives.

Every person, no matter what his profession is, relies on selling. The politician wants to appeal to you and your interests so that you’ll vote for him in the polling booth. The public speaker is hoping to convince the audience that his approach is the right one. The employee desiring a promotion will have to sell the boss on his value to the company. 

## Chapter 3

99 percent of all “professional” salespeople have only a slight idea of what selling is, much less how to actually determine and predict results

There are vast shortages of highly committed, highly dedicated, and great salespeople.

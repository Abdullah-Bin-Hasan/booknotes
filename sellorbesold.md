## Notes by Christopher Durr

## CHAPTER ONE SELLING—A WAY OF LIFE

The ability to get others to like you, work with you, and want to please you determines how well you will survive.

The truth is, businesses fail first and foremost because their ideas weren’t sold quickly enough and in quantities great enough, and therefore they ran out of money.

A sale is made in every exchange of ideas or communication—there are no exceptions. Deny it if you will, but that won’t change the facts. You’re a salesperson, and you’re one every single day of your life.

Every time you get your way, you’ve just been paid a commission.

Confrontation and pressure are attributes of the amateur who doesn’t understand sales and ends up resorting to unpleasant tactics.

People continue to pass on the false information that selling is hard, that it’s difficult to depend on commissions, that selling is sleazy, that you’ll have to work long hours, that it isn’t a dependable profession, that you can’t rely on the income, and that it’s not considered a “real” job! It’s a shame, because selling as a profession offers a great deal of freedom and numerous financial benefits.

A person’s ability to persuade another is the only thing that will ultimately ensure a position in the marketplace. Academic records, grades, and résumés won’t guarantee you a promotion or advancement in life, but the ability to sell will.

## Chapter 2

A basic education, while very necessary, cannot be considered an “end all.” While there are some great teachers in the school system, it’s unfortunate that due to the ridiculously low salaries, many of them are only regurgitating curriculums and forcing students to study courses and subjects that will never be used in their day-to-day lives.

Every person, no matter what his profession is, relies on selling. The politician wants to appeal to you and your interests so that you’ll vote for him in the polling booth. The public speaker is hoping to convince the audience that his approach is the right one. The employee desiring a promotion will have to sell the boss on his value to the company. 

## Chapter 3

99 percent of all “professional” salespeople have only a slight idea of what selling is, much less how to actually determine and predict results

There are vast shortages of highly committed, highly dedicated, and great salespeople.

## Chapter 4

To the degree that you aren’t proud of the job you’re doing, you won’t be successful; and the degree to which you are successful will determine how proud you are of your career. The career you are in is not the problem—your commitment is the problem

Commitment = Results = Happiness

The ability to predict is the first thing that happens when you become a professional, and when I reached this level of ability, I knew I was on my way to great success.

How does one gain the skill of prediction? You have to start looking at everything that’s happening, observe it accurately without emotion or blame, and make a note of it. The ability to predict comes from assuming responsibility for what’s going on around you and believing you can control it.

The only reason a person doesn’t like what he’s doing is because he doesn’t know what he’s doing

Most salespeople are amateurs, some of them are professionals, and only a few are greats. Ultimately, it comes down to the level of commitment and dedication you have

## Chapter 5

You’ve got to be absolutely convinced that your product, your company, your services, or your ideas are superior to all others.

The conviction that you have regarding your product is more important than the conviction that others have about their facts and figures.

Become so thoroughly sold on your product that your conviction is irresistible to others. 

There’s always been competition and there always will be. The problem isn’t product knowledge, competition, or smarter customers; the real issue is whether or not you are fully sold on your product.

People will follow you to your chiropractor, consult your doctor, hire your maid, or go to the movie you recommended—all because of what you did, not what you said. 

## Chapter 6

Getting the sale isn’t about money; it’s ultimately about the buyer having confidence that the product is the right one.
If there is a price difference, the customer wants assurance that your product has advantages in excess of the cost difference.

If the price gets too cheap, people won’t see any value in the product. 

Always try to move the buyer up to a bigger or more expensive product as the first solution to price objection.

Your prospect is never the problem—never! Salespeople, not the prospect, are the ultimate barriers to every sale.

You have to have a positive outlook about people. You have to believe that people are good and that they want to make the right decision.

## Chapter 7

Get over the idea that there’s a scarcity of money because there isn’t! There’s plenty of money to go around. If you start looking for prosperity and abundance, you’ll see that these things exist all around you.

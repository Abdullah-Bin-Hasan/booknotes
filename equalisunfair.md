# Part 1: Making Sense of the Debate

## Chapter 1: Who cares about inequality?

Polls consistently show that inequality is very low on Americans’ list of concerns.

What we do care deeply about is the opportunity to make a better life for ourselves—and we are more likely to celebrate the fact that this allows some people to succeed beyond their wildest dreams than lose sleep over it.

In many cases, the connection between rising inequality and declining mobility is never fully spelled out: 
We are simply told that, for instance, the highly unequal United States has less economic mobility than our counterparts in Europe

Explanations for how inequality slows growth are all over the map, ranging from the claim that it reduces consumer spending, supposedly the driving force of economic growth, to the claim that inequality makes workers less happy and therefore less productive.

A rise in inequality per se doesn’t give us any reason to suspect that someone has been robbed or exploited or is even worse off.

When individuals create something, there is no presumption that they should end up with equal shares.

The Founding Fathers established a nation based on the principle, not of economic equality, but political equality.
Political equality refers to equality of *rights*.

Protecting people’s equal rights inevitably leads to enormous differences in economic condition, as some people use their freedom to create modest amounts of wealth while others reach the highest levels of success.

## Chapter 2: Examinining the inequaltity narrative

The inequality narrative places the blame for rising inequality and declining opportunity squarely at the feet of “the 1 percent,” and implies that the solution is to tax them, regulate them, and curtail their political influence.

Not only are the data sometimes sketchy, but there are many options in deciding which data to use.
 
Life expectancy from birth rose from 38 in 1850 to nearly 60 by 1925, driven by advances in medicine, sanitation, and economic progress generally.
 
What we care about is not wage rates per se, but our actual standard of living, and there is no question that war and restrictive immigration policies lower our standard of living.

Low-skilled workers tend to bid down wages for low-skilled work, which sounds bad until you remember that this lowers the cost of the products we all buy. And high-skilled workers bring us all the benefits of their ability, which includes starting new businesses
 
Economic freedom expanded in the post-war period as significant parts of the New Deal regulatory regime were rolled back, and continued to expand until the early 1970s when it once again contracted.
 
While unions can raise wages for some people, they can only do so temporarily and at the expense of other people. They cannot raise wages in general without raising costs and, thereby, the prices that we all have to pay

All else being equal, taxes discourage production and prosperity. Not only do they dampen the incentive to produce, but they also tend to reduce the capital accumulation that funds new buildings, machinery, R&D, and jobs. 
 
Social security was a redistribution not from the rich to everyone else but mostly from middle-class workers to middle-class retirees.

Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) catalogs all federal regulations. The CFR has seen almost constant growth, starting at 19,335 pages in 1949 and growing to 134,261 pages by 2005

Three useful measures of well-being: life expectancy, spending on “basics,” and the goods and services middle-income Americans can actually consume.

**Household Composition**

 One factor that can alter income estimates is a change in household composition. If there is a rise in divorce or if couples wait longer to get married, this will tend to make people look worse off, even if their actual standard of living has stayed the same or increased.
 
 **Immigration Trends**
 
 When immigrants come and take jobs that, by American standards, are low-paying. We can appear to stagnate or get poorer—even if every flesh-and-blood individual is better off.
  
 **Employer Benefits**
 
 If employers become more flexible with hours or working arrangements, or offer more pleasant working conditions, this can entice employees to accept lower wages
 
 **Inflation Adjustments**
 
 It’s generally recognized that the CPI-U overstates inflation and so tends to underestimate how much better off people are over time
 
 **Economic Unit**
 
 In a four-person household in which one parent works, treating the individual as the unit of well-being would show one well-off individual, and three people living in dire poverty. 
 
 If post-tax, post-transfer income is considered, household income for the middle fifth rose 36 percent during 1979 - 2010
 
# Part 2: Discovering the American Dream
 
## Chapter 3: The Land of Opportunity
 
In pursuing a program of economic equality, communists rejected any concern for political equality.

Cuba’s ideological foundation is *collectivism*. America’s is *individualism*

Individuals can and should cooperate—but only on terms each individual voluntarily agrees to. 

The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. 

To be a success is to find a productive endeavor that you love and do all that you can to be the best you can be

No one owes you a living.

Individuals are oppressed through political power, and, as a result, they live in abject poverty, subsisting on as little as a dollar a day.

We can’t evaluate work opportunities in a given economy according to how they compare to the opportunities we have. We have to compare them to the next best alternatives that are actually available in those countries.

Wages are low in the third world because worker productivity is low (upper bound) and workers’ alternatives are lousy (lower bound).

In a free society, opportunities are abundant, but we have to exercise thought and effort in order to transform them into achievements.

Common is the person who is willing to work, but who doesn’t approach his career or his life thoughtfully or ambitiously. 
Although he may show up on time and do what’s required of him, he is essentially passive and believes that changing conditions should never require him to learn more or change his routine.

It is entirely possible to overcome our disadvantages and build a career for ourselves that is financially and spiritually rewarding.

Even in today’s world, in which too many communities are hostile to success, and in which too many government policies make success more difficult to achieve, success is possible—but only if an individual doesn’t accept the role of a victim, 
doesn’t wait around for society to cure all its social and economic ills, and instead fights to make something of himself.
 
When people are taught that they cannot succeed through their own efforts, those who accept that notion will naturally come to resent those who try to succeed through their own efforts, creating the crab-pot phenomenon that drags so many people down. 

If we genuinely care about opportunity, we need to reject the egalitarian concept of equality of opportunity, and put the focus squarely back on equality of rights and the freedom it gives us

## Chapter 4: The conditions of Progress

In the United States, infant mortality has declined from 26 out of every 1,000 births in 1960 to only 6 out of 1,000 in 2011

From a long-term historical perspective, more of us are living longer, safer, richer lives than ever before. 

Wealth creation is first and foremost knowledge creation. And this is why you can add to the list of people who have created the modern world, great thinkers

The word “entrepreneur” comes from the French word entreprendre, which means to “undertake” and is thought to have been coined by the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say.

The core of what enables you to achieve your career goals is your knowledge, skills, judgment, and intellectual effort. 

Since 1981, the fraction of the earth’s population living on less than a dollar a day has dropped from over 40 percent to only 14 percent.

The rise of individualism, and its glorification of reason and freedom, made it possible for individuals to use their reason to reshape the earth into a place progressively more hospitable to human life and happiness.

For innovation to flourish, individuals need (1) the freedom to challenge old ideas and adopt new ones, (2) the freedom to put new ideas into practice, (3) the freedom of others in society to adopt or reject the innovator’s ideas, and (4) the freedom of the innovator to profit from successful innovations

By using these economies of scale, Andrew Carnegie, for instance, was able to reduce the cost of making steel from about $100 a ton to only $12 a ton, while John D. Rockefeller was able to cut production costs of a gallon of kerosene from 1.5 cents a gallon to .45 cents a gallon

Every country that experiences steady economic progress also has enormous levels of inequality, including so-called low-inequality countries, such as those in Scandinavia.

There is no theoretical reason why differences in income or wealth should slow human progress. The notion that “spending drives the economy” and that rich people spend less than others isn’t a view seriously entertained by economists, who on the whole recognize that savings, investment, and innovation are what make us richer.

If we look at the history of Scandinavian countries, we find that they have prospered during periods in which they had more economic freedom (and higher inequality), and they have faltered in periods in which they had less freedom (and lower inequality)

Ability and Effort + Freedom = Opportunity

# Part 3: The betrayal of Opportunity

## Chapter 5: The War on Opportunity

The only way to succeed over the long run is by continually exercising ability

Mobility statistics lump together people who do work hard and people who don’t, as well as people who don’t advance for any number of other reasons.

Over the period 1996 to 2005, more than 50 percent of the poorest families moved up at least one quintile

Regulations impose substantial compliance costs on a business—costs that an established business with a bull pen of attorneys can more easily meet, but which can stop upstarts in their tracks.

A 2014 study by Miles Corak (University of Ottawa), Matthew J. Lindquist (SOFI, Stockholm University), and Bhashkar Mazumder (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago) suggests that the lower overall mobility in the U.S. is almost solely the product of less downward mobility.

# Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat

# Part 1

Happiness in the modern world is surrounded by myths. Much of our understanding of what happiness is and where to find it is distorted.
When you know what you’re looking for, the quest becomes easy. It may take time to unlearn old habits, but as long as you stick to the path, you’ll get there.

## Chapter 1: Setting up the equation

For human beings, simply put, the default state is happiness. Happiness is the absence of unhappiness.

Success, wealth, power, and fame don’t lead to happiness. 

Being happy made people roughly 12 percent more productive and, accordingly, more likely to get ahead

**Exercise**

Pull out a pencil and a piece of paper, and jot down some of the things that make you happy.

It’s the thought, not the actual event, that’s making you unhappy.

As much as we hate it, pain and the discomforts of life are useful!

We let our suffering linger as a form of self-generated pain.

Happiness starts with a conscious choice.

## Chapter 2: 6 - 7 - 5

Most events, when seen for what they really are, are absolutely consistent with how we should expect life to behave.

fun is useful, but some people seek it in desperation, to escape, because they’re afraid of their difficult thoughts. In that sense, the fun they chase is like a painkiller, to blunt the suffering.

fun is as an emergency off switch to allow for momentary intervals of peace so that you can get the voice in your head to chill

True joy is to be in harmony with life exactly as it is.

You should never settle for anything less than joy.

# Part 2: Grand Illusions

## Chapter 3: That little voice in your head

The little voice in your head is not you!

The more something matters, the more incessant thought will be left out of it.

The repetitive loop of thinking of an event, comparing it unfavorably to our expectations, leads to suffering

* Observe the dialogue
* Observe the drama

You can prime your brain to focus on anything you want just by bringing it into consciousness.
With infinite choices, what should you tell your brain to think about? Happy thoughts

Happiness is always found in the positive side of every concept.

So much of your happiness depends not on the conditions of the world around you but on the thoughts you create about them. 

## Chapter 4: Who are you?

* You are not your body
* You’re not your emotions.
* You’re not your beliefs.
* You’re not the tribe you belong to.
* You are not your achievements
* You are not your possessions

Your addiction to maintaining your image is then intermixed with an addiction to attention. 

The work we do, not the mask we wear, is what pushes us forward.

When our self-image is attacked or threatened in any way, our instinct engages to protect our ego

Trying constantly to get approval for your chosen image is a losing battle because the real you isn’t what the ego pretends to be.

You’ll never please everyone. Find those who like the real you and invite them closer. All others don’t matter to you.

Everything is both good and bad. Or perhaps everything is neither.

## Chapter 5: What you know

Every question you’ll ever ask will be governed by a refinement cycle that I call DDAA: Discovery, Debate, Acceptance, Arrogance.

A fundamental limitation on our knowledge is to be found in the very building blocks we use to think and communicate. We use words to define concepts, but there’s no way words can encompass them fully.

We truly don’t know that much after all.

“Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance.”

When you realize that every seemingly bad event nudged you onto the path of many good events, you’ll reset your definitions of good and bad.

## Chapter 6: Does anybody know what time it is?

The nature of time itself is still illusory. 

All of space and all of time exist perpetually.

Happy emotions are mostly anchored in the present.

When we’re focused on the past or the future, we’re living in our thoughts, and not in reality.

Every time you examine your thoughts you’ll notice that whatever you’re upset about is rooted in a past you cannot change or a future that may turn out to be completely different from what you expect.

## Chapter 7: Houston, we have a problem

Our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly to large deviations, extends much further than our conscious awareness can even comprehend. This dovetails with what meteorologist Edward Lorenz called “the Butterfly Effect,” the ability of seemingly minor and unrelated events to cause major changes. 

Between black swans and butterfly effects, nothing is under your control.

Take the responsible action first, then release the need to control.

“It is all going to be fine in the end. If it is not yet fine, then it is not yet the end.”

## Chapter 8: Might as well jump

How to remove fear:

1. Admit that you're afraid
2. Understand what fear is
3. Name your fear
4. Understand your brain's fear games
5. Take the Vow
6. Take the Leap

What keeps us alive and propels us forward are our actions, not our fears. Fear, if anything, paralyzes us.

The only thing life wants is to be experienced.

If you can afford the brain cycles to worry about the future, then by definition, you have nothing to worry about right now.

Simple questions to overcome fears:

1. What's the worst that can happen?
2. So what?
3. How likely is it?
4. Is there anything I can do now to prevent this scenario?
5. Can I recover?
6. What will happen if I do nothing?
7. What is the best-care scenario

# Part 3: Blind Spots

## Chapter 9: Is it true?

In any situation you’ll notice that your brain has a tendency to spot what’s wrong and what can represent a threat. Only a lot less frequently will your brain pick up on what’s going right or what’s mundane.

Ample research has shown that we tend to think negative—self-critical, pessimistic, and fearful—thoughts more often than positive thoughts.

We tend to remember negative traits more easily. As a result, we tend to recall negatives more often. 

Seven Blind Spots:

1. Filters: The story your brain tells you is always incomplete.
2. Assumptions: An assumption is nothing more than a brain-generated story. It’s not the truth!
3. Predictions: Predicting something will happen often lays the path to make it happen.
4. Memories: Your memories are nothing more than a record of what you think happened. They’re often not the truth!
5. Labels: In the absence of context, labels very often cover up the truth.
6. Emotions: We’re not as rational as we think. Our perception of the truth is often distracted by our irrational emotions.
7. Exaggeration: What’s more than the truth is less than true.

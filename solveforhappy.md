# Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat

# Part 1

Happiness in the modern world is surrounded by myths. Much of our understanding of what happiness is and where to find it is distorted.
When you know what you’re looking for, the quest becomes easy. It may take time to unlearn old habits, but as long as you stick to the path, you’ll get there.

## Chapter 1: Setting up the equation

For human beings, simply put, the default state is happiness. Happiness is the absence of unhappiness.

Success, wealth, power, and fame don’t lead to happiness. 

Being happy made people roughly 12 percent more productive and, accordingly, more likely to get ahead

**Exercise**

Pull out a pencil and a piece of paper, and jot down some of the things that make you happy.

It’s the thought, not the actual event, that’s making you unhappy.

As much as we hate it, pain and the discomforts of life are useful!

We let our suffering linger as a form of self-generated pain.

Happiness starts with a conscious choice.

## Chapter 2: 6 - 7 - 5

Most events, when seen for what they really are, are absolutely consistent with how we should expect life to behave.

fun is useful, but some people seek it in desperation, to escape, because they’re afraid of their difficult thoughts. In that sense, the fun they chase is like a painkiller, to blunt the suffering.

fun is as an emergency off switch to allow for momentary intervals of peace so that you can get the voice in your head to chill

True joy is to be in harmony with life exactly as it is.

You should never settle for anything less than joy.

## Chapter 3: That little voice in your head

The little voice in your head is not you!

The more something matters, the more incessant thought will be left out of it.

The repetitive loop of thinking of an event, comparing it unfavorably to our expectations, leads to suffering

* Observe the dialogue
* Observe the drama

You can prime your brain to focus on anything you want just by bringing it into consciousness.
With infinite choices, what should you tell your brain to think about? Happy thoughts

Happiness is always found in the positive side of every concept.

So much of your happiness depends not on the conditions of the world around you but on the thoughts you create about them. 

## Chapter 4: Who are you?

* You are not your body
* You’re not your emotions.
* You’re not your beliefs.
* You’re not the tribe you belong to.
* You are not your achievements
* You are not your possessions

Your addiction to maintaining your image is then intermixed with an addiction to attention. 

The work we do, not the mask we wear, is what pushes us forward.

When our self-image is attacked or threatened in any way, our instinct engages to protect our ego

Trying constantly to get approval for your chosen image is a losing battle because the real you isn’t what the ego pretends to be.

You’ll never please everyone. Find those who like the real you and invite them closer. All others don’t matter to you.

Everything is both good and bad. Or perhaps everything is neither.

## Chapter 5: What you know

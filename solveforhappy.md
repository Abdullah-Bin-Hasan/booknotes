# Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat

# Part 1

Happiness in the modern world is surrounded by myths. Much of our understanding of what happiness is and where to find it is distorted.
When you know what you’re looking for, the quest becomes easy. It may take time to unlearn old habits, but as long as you stick to the path, you’ll get there.

## Chapter 1: Setting up the equation

For human beings, simply put, the default state is happiness. Happiness is the absence of unhappiness.

Success, wealth, power, and fame don’t lead to happiness. 

Being happy made people roughly 12 percent more productive and, accordingly, more likely to get ahead

**Exercise**

Pull out a pencil and a piece of paper, and jot down some of the things that make you happy.

It’s the thought, not the actual event, that’s making you unhappy.

As much as we hate it, pain and the discomforts of life are useful!

We let our suffering linger as a form of self-generated pain.

Happiness starts with a conscious choice.

## Chapter 2: 6 - 7 - 5

Most events, when seen for what they really are, are absolutely consistent with how we should expect life to behave.

fun is useful, but some people seek it in desperation, to escape, because they’re afraid of their difficult thoughts. In that sense, the fun they chase is like a painkiller, to blunt the suffering.

fun is as an emergency off switch to allow for momentary intervals of peace so that you can get the voice in your head to chill

True joy is to be in harmony with life exactly as it is.

You should never settle for anything less than joy.

# Winning by Jack Welch
## Notes by Christopher Durr

# Chapter 1: Missions and Values

**Mission**

These two terms have got to be among the most abstract, overused, misunderstood words in business

A good mission statement and a good set of values are so real they smack you in the face with their concreteness. 

An effective mission statement basically answers one question: *How do we intend to win in this business?*

A mission cannot, and must not, be delegated to anyone except the people ultimately held accountable for it. 

**Values**

Such a document should go out to be poked and probed by people all over an organization, over and over again. 

You cannot be too specific about values and their related behaviors. There is too much to lose by not getting your mission
straight and by not making your values concrete

## Chapter 2: Candor

Too many people instinctively don’t express themselves with frankness

Forget outside competition when your own worst enemy is the way you communicate with one another internally

When you tell it like it is, you can so easily create a mess—anger, pain, confusion, sadness, resentment. 

To get candor, you reward it, praise it, and talk about it. You make public heroes out of people who demonstrate it. 
Most of all, you yourself demonstrate it in an exuberant and even exaggerated way

You’ll have an easier time of installing candor in your organization if you are closer to the top.

Candor works because candor unclutters

## Chapter 3: Differentiation

Companies win when their managers make a clear and meaningful
distinction between top and bottom performing businesses
and people

Managers at every level have to make hard choices and live by them. 

As for the bottom 10 percent in differentiation, there is no sugarcoating
this—they have to go

When differentiation is working, people know where they
stand. You know if you have a strong shot at a big promotion or if
you need to be looking for other opportunities, inside or outside
the company

Protecting underperformers always backfires. 

The system is 20 - 70 - 10

Differentiation rewards those members of the team who
deserve it. That annoys only the underperformers. To
everyone else, it seems fair. 

## Chapter 4: Voice and Dignity

Every person in the world wants voice and dignity, and every person deserves them. 

The majority of people in most organizations don’t say anything because they feel they can’t— and because they haven’t been asked. 

Implement a way to have people in your organization heard

## Chapter 5: Leadership

When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 

1. Leaders relentlessly upgrade their team, using every encounter as an opportunity to evaluate, coach, and build self-confidence.
2. Leaders make sure people not only see the vision, they live and breathe it.
3. Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism.
4. Leaders establish trust with candor, transparency, and credit.
5. Leaders have the courage to make unpopular decisions and gut calls.
6. Leaders probe and push with a curiosity that borders on skepticism, making sure their questions are answered with action.
7. Leaders inspire risk taking and learning by setting the example.
8. Leaders celebrate. 

## Chapter 6: Hiring

Before you even think about assessing people for a job, they have to pass through three screens. The first is for integrity, the second is for intelligence, and the third for maturity. 

Four E's a person you're hiring should have:

* Positive Energy
* Energizes others
* Edge - The courage to make tough yes-or-no decisions
* Execution - The ability to get the job done. 
* Finally, Passion

If you're hiring a senior leader, they also need the following qualities:

* Authenticity
* Ability to see around corners
* Penchant to surround themselves with people better and smarter than they are 
* Heavy-Duty resilience. Do they learn from their mistakes?

Don't ever rely on one meeting to hire somebody for a job. Be impressed if candidates give you hard, tough questions. 

When calling references, force yourself to challenge anything that sounds like lawyer-speak

## Chapter 7: People Management

To manage people well, companies should:

1. Elevate HR to a position of power and primacy in the organization, and make sure HR people have the special qualities to help managers build leaders and careers. 
2. Use a rigorous, nonbureaucratic evaluation system, monitored for integrity with the same intensity as Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance.
3. Create effective mechanisms: money, recognition, and training—to motivate and retain.
4. Face straight into charged relationships—with unions, stars, sliders, and disrupters.
5. Fight gravity, and instead of taking the middle 70 percent for granted, treat them like the heart and soul of the organization.
6. Design the org chart to be as flat as possible, with blindingly clear reporting relationships and responsibilities.

When measuring people, it should measure people on relevant, agreed upon criteria that relate directly to an individual’s performance. It should be quantitative. It should also ensure that managers evaluate their people at least once a year, and preferably twice, in formal, face-to-face sessions.

Make it so that nobody in your organization is indispensable. 

## Chapter 8: Parting Ways

There are three types of firings:

1. Firings for integrity violations— stealing, lying, cheating, or any other form of ethical or legal breach
2. Layoffs due to economic downturns
3. Firings for nonperformance

Firings for integrity violations are no-brainers. Fire them immediately and let others know why they're being fired

Let employees know how the company is doing financially so there's no surprise for layoffs. 

Three big mistakes of firing:

1. Moving too fast
2. Not using enough candor
3. Taking too long

## Chapter 9: Change

When making change in a company

1. Attach every change initiative to a clear purpose or goal. Change for change’s sake is stupid and enervating.
2. Hire and promote only true believers and get-on with-it types. 
3. Ferret out and get rid of resisters, even if their performance is satisfactory.
4. Look at disasters. These may be possible business opportunities

## Chapter 10: Crisis Management

First, assume the problem is worse than it appears. 

Second, assume there are no secrets in the world and that everyone will eventually find out everything

Third, assume you and your organization’s handling of the crisis will be portrayed in the worst possible light. 

Fourth, assume there will be changes in processes and people. Almost no crisis ends without blood on the floor. 

Fifth, assume your organization will survive, ultimately stronger for what happened.

## Chapter 11: Strategy

Forget the scenario planning, yearlong studies, and hundred-plus-page reports. They’re time-consuming and expensive,
and you just don’t need them. In real life, strategy is actually very straightforward. You pick a
general direction and implement like hell. 

First, come up with a big aha for your business—a smart, realistic, relatively fast way to gain sustainable competitive
advantage. Second, put the right people in the right jobs to drive the big aha forward. 
Third, relentlessly seek out the best practices to achieve  your big aha, whether inside or out, adapt them, and continually
improve them. 

When developing a strategy for your company, ask yourself the following questions:

1. What does the playing field look like?

* Who are the competitors in this business, large and small, new and old?
* Who has what share, globally and in each market?
* Where do we fit in?
* What are the characteristics of this business? Is it commodity or high value or somewhere in between?
* Is it long cycle or short? Where is it on the growth curve? What are the drivers of profitability?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of each competitor? How good are their products? How much does each one spend on R & D? How big is each sales force? How performance-driven is each culture?
* Who are this business’s main customers, and how do they buy?

2. What has the competition been up to?

* What has each competitor done in the past year to change the playing field?
* Has anyone introduced game-changing new products, new technologies, or a new distribution channel?
* Are there any new entrants, and what have they been up to in the past year? 

3. What have you been up to?

* What have you done in the past year to change the competitive playing field?
* Have you bought a company, introduced a new product, stolen a competitor’s key salesperson, or licensed a new technology from a start-up?
* Have you lost any competitive advantages that you once had—a great salesperson, a special product, a proprietary technology? 

4. What's around the corner?

* What scares you most in the year ahead—what one or two things could a competitor do to nail you?
* What new products or technologies could your competitors launch that might change the game?
* What M & A deals would knock you off your feet? 

5. What's your winning move?

* What can you do to change the playing field—is it an acquisition, a new product, globalization?
* What can you do to make customers stick to you more than ever before and more than to anyone else? 

## Chapter 12: Budgeting

A budgeting dynamic that saps value is the **phony smile**.  Phony Smile plans are filled with good ideas and exciting
opportunities. The people in the field have bold dreams about
what they can do—make an acquisition, for example, or develop
new products—given the right amount of investment. The
trouble arises when headquarters is secretive about the process,
when they don’t explain the rationale behind their decisions. 

Compensation for individuals and businesses should not be linked to performance against budget. It is linked primarily to
performance against the prior year and against the competition

## Chapter 13: Organic Growth

To give any new venture a fighting chance to succeed, you
do have to set it free (somewhat). And you do need to spend more
money on it and cheer louder and longer for it than may feel
comfortable. 

There are three common mistakes made when launching a company:

1. Not enough adequate resources
2. Make too little fanfare about the importance of the new venture
3. They limit the new venture's autonomy

How to make organic growth a winning proposition:
1.  Spend plenty up front, and put the best, hungriest, and most passionate people in leadership roles
2. Make an exaggerated commotion about the potential and importance of the new venture
3. Err on the side of freedom; get off the new venture’s back. 

If you're the one running the venture:

Fight like hell. Get yourself in front of senior management and
make your case. And work the personnel front on your own.
Ferret out good candidates both inside and outside the company,
and make your pitch directly to them. Just go get the best people,
even if you have to throw a few elbows. 

## Chapter 14: Mergers and Acquisitions

Merging right is ultimately about avoiding seven pitfalls:

1. Believing that a merger of equals can actually occur.
2. Focusing so intently on strategic fit that you fail to assess cultural fit
3. Entering into a “reverse hostage situation,” in which the acquirer ends up making so many concessions during negotiations that the acquired ends up calling all the shots
4. Integrating too timidly. With good leadership, a merger should be complete within ninety days. 
5. Conqueror syndrome, in which the acquiring company marches in and installs its own managers everywhere, undermining one of the reasons for any merger
6. Paying too much. Not 5 or 10 percent too much, but so much that the premium can never be recouped in the integration. 
7. Resistance. In a merger, new owners will always select people with buy-in over resisters with brains. If you want to survive, get over your angst and learn 

## Chapter 15: Six Sigma

Perhaps the biggest but most unheralded benefit of Six Sigma is its capacity to develop a cadre of great leaders. 

Six Sigma is a quality program that, when all is said and done, improves your customers’ experience,lowers your costs,and builds better leaders.

Six Sigma has two primary applications. First, it can be used to remove the variation in routine, relatively simple, repetitive tasks—activities that happen over and over again. Second, it can be used to make sure large, complex projects go right the first time

## Chapter 16: The Right Job

It is virtually impossible to know where any given job will take you. 

It can feel very noble to say that you don’t care about being rich; it’s another
thing to live with that decision over the years, especially as mortgages and tuitions start to pile up. 

**People**

If you join a company where your sensibilities don’t fit in, you’ll find yourself putting on a persona just to get along. 

**Opportunity**

Any job you take should feel somewhat challenging going in. It should make you think, “I can do most of the work, but there
are certainly skills and knowledge this job requires that I don’t have yet. I’m going to learn something here.”

**Options**

Some companies open—or close—doors for you because of their reputation. Others do that because of their industry. 

Working to fulfill someone else’s needs or dreams almost always catches up with you. 

**Work Content**

Finding a job that touches your core is not hard. Such jobs are everywhere—every piece of work has the potential, since it only has to feel important to you.

Nothing will get you a new job faster than terrific performance in your old one. 


## Chapter 17: Getting promoted

How does a person get promoted? The first answer is luck. All careers, no matter how scripted
they appear, are shaped by some element of pure chance. 

Getting promoted takes one do and one don’t

* Do deliver sensational performance, far beyond expectations, and at every opportunity expand your job beyond its official boundaries. 
* Don’t make your boss use political capital in order to champion you.

Come up with a new concept or process that doesn’t improve just
your results, but your unit’s results and the company’s overall
performance. Change your job in a way that makes the people
around you work better and your boss look smarter. Don’t just do
the predictable. 

Don’t make your boss ask the perfect question to get
information from you. If you want your character to stand up for you and make life easy for your boss, open up and tell it like it is. 

Some dos and don'ts:

* Manage your relationships with your subordinates with the same carefulness that you manage the one with your boss.
* Get on the radar screen by being an early champion of your company’s major projects or initiatives.
* Search out and relish the input of lots of mentors, realizing that mentors don’t always look like mentors.
* Have a positive attitude and spread it around. 

## Chapter 18: Hard Spots

In any bad boss situation, you cannot let yourself be a victim. 

In any business situation, seeing yourself as a victim is completely self-defeating. And when it comes to your career, it’s an attitude that kills all your options—it can even be the start of a career death spiral.

Ask yourself the following questions:

* Why is my boss acting like a jerk?
* What’s the endgame for my boss?
* What will happen to me if I deliver results and endure my bad boss? 
* Why do I work here everyday?

It’s possible great numbers will keep your bad boss around indefinitely.

About 90 percent of the time, complaining
about a bad boss to his boss will make the situation worse.

## Chapter 19: Work-Life Balance

The reality of the situation:

1. 1.Your boss’s top priority is competitiveness. Of course he wants you to be happy, but only inasmuch as it helps the company win. 
2. Most bosses are perfectly willing to accommodate work-life balance challenges if you have earned it with performance.The key word here is: if. 
3. The work-life policies in the company brochure are mainly for recruiting purposes and that real work-life arrangements are negotiated one-on-one
4.  People who publicly struggle with work-life balance problems and continually turn to the company for help get pigeonholed as ambivalent, entitled, uncommitted, or incompetent
5. Even the most accommodating bosses believe that work-life balance is your problem to solve.

Best Practices for a good work-life balance:

1. Keep your head in whatever game you’re at.
2. Have the mettle to say no to requests and demands outside your chosen work-life balance plan.
3. Make sure your work-life balance plan doesn’t leave you out. 

## Chapter 20: Here there and everywhere

In the heat of battle, it always feels like the worst of times. Low-cost competitors are not new.

Don’t think about reducing costs by 5 to 10 percent. You have to find the ways to take out 30 to 40 percent

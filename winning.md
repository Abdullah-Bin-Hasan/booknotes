# Winning by Jack Welch
## Notes by Christopher Durr

# Chapter 1: Missions and Values

**Mission**

These two terms have got to be among the most abstract, overused, misunderstood words in business

A good mission statement and a good set of values are so real they smack you in the face with their concreteness. 

An effective mission statement basically answers one question: *How do we intend to win in this business?*

A mission cannot, and must not, be delegated to anyone except the people ultimately held accountable for it. 

**Values**

Such a document should go out to be poked and probed by people all over an organization, over and over again. 

You cannot be too specific about values and their related behaviors. There is too much to lose by not getting your mission
straight and by not making your values concrete

## Chapter 2: Candor

Too many people instinctively don’t express themselves with frankness

Forget outside competition when your own worst enemy is the way you communicate with one another internally

When you tell it like it is, you can so easily create a mess—anger, pain, confusion, sadness, resentment. 

To get candor, you reward it, praise it, and talk about it. You make public heroes out of people who demonstrate it. 
Most of all, you yourself demonstrate it in an exuberant and even exaggerated way

You’ll have an easier time of installing candor in your organization if you are closer to the top.

Candor works because candor unclutters

# Never Split the Difference 

## Chapter 1: The New Rules

**Calibrated questions**: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers

Man has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional;
System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And System 1 is far more influential. In fact, it guides and
steers our rational thoughts.

By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand
what the other side is experiencing.

In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your prerogative to ask for what you think is right.

## CHAPTER 2: BE A MIRROR

You should engage the process with a mindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much
information as possible. 

We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our
minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. 

The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or
otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want.
The latter will help you discover the former

Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a
hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trust
we’ve built. 

**Late-Night, FM DJ Voice**: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring.

When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to
collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). 

A “mirror” is when you repeat the last three words (or
the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety of the FBI’s hostage
negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily
effective.

It’s just four simple steps:

1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice.
2. Start with “I’m sorry . . .”
3. Mirror.
4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.

People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the
voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The
goal is to uncover as much information as possible.

To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other
person and what they have to say.

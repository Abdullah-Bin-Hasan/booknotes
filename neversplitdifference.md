# Never Split the Difference 

## Chapter 1: The New Rules

**Calibrated questions**: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers

Man has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional;
System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And System 1 is far more influential. In fact, it guides and
steers our rational thoughts.

By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand
what the other side is experiencing.

In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your prerogative to ask for what you think is right.

## CHAPTER 2: BE A MIRROR

You should engage the process with a mindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much
information as possible. 

We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our
minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. 

The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or
otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want.
The latter will help you discover the former

Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a
hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trust
we’ve built. 

**Late-Night, FM DJ Voice**: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring.

When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to
collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). 

A “mirror” is when you repeat the last three words (or
the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety of the FBI’s hostage
negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily
effective.

It’s just four simple steps:

1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice.
2. Start with “I’m sorry . . .”
3. Mirror.
4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.

People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the
voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The
goal is to uncover as much information as possible.

To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other
person and what they have to say.

## Chapter 3: Don't feel their pain, label it

Emotions aren’t the obstacles, they are the means.

Playing dumb is a valid negotiating technique, and “I don’t
understand” is a legitimate response. But ignoring the other party’s position only builds up frustration
and makes them less likely to do what you want.

When we closely observe a person’s face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process
called neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and feel

Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone’s emotion
a name and you show you identify with how that person feels. Once you’ve thrown out a label, be quiet and listen.

The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative
and diffuse it.

List every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, an *accusation audit*

Remember you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. So
use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.

## Chaper 4: BEWARE “YES”—MASTER “NO”

For good negotiators, “No” is pure gold. That negative provides a great
opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t
want. 

“No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it

Your invitation for the other side to say “No” has an amazing power to bring
down barriers and allow for beneficial communication.

There are actually three kinds of “Yes”: Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment.

Using all your skills to create rapport, agreement, and connection with a counterpart is useful, but
ultimately that connection is useless unless the other person feels that they are equally as responsible,
if not solely responsible, for creating the connection and the new ideas they have.

Sometimes, if you’re talking to somebody who is just not listening, the
only way you can crack their cranium is to antagonize them into “No.”
One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party’s emotions or desires

## Chapter 5: Trigger the two words that immediately transform any negotiation

The sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually “That’s right.”

How to trigger somebody to say "That's right":

1. Effective Pauses: Silence is powerful. 
2. Minimal Encouragers
3. Mirroring
4. Labeling
5. Paraphrase
6. Summarize: Paraphrasing + Labeling

Driving toward “that’s right” is a winning strategy in all negotiations. But hearing “you’re right” is a
disaster.

Creating unconditional positive regard opens the door to changing thoughts and
behaviors. Humans have an innate urge toward socially constructive behavior. The more
a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely
that urge for constructive behavior will take hold.

## Chapter 6: Bend Their Reality

Negotiation is never a linear formula: add X to Y to get Z. We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions

We don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face.

Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think—or are told—they will.

While we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion.

Early on in a negotiation, say, “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.”

People are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the **Certainty Effect** 

How to get leverage in a negotiation:

1. Anchor their emotions
2. Let the other guy go first: let the other side anchor monetary negotiations.
3. Establish a range
4. Pivot to nonmonetary terms
5. When talking numbers, use odd ones
6. Give a gift

How to negotiate a better salary

1. Be persistent on nonsalary issues
2. Have salary terms and success terms
3. Spark their interest in your success and gain a mentor

The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side
on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don’t
get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you’re mistreating them.

## Chapter 7: Create the illusion of control

What about this is important to you?
* How can I help to make this better for us?
* How would you like me to proceed?
* What is it that brought us into this situation?
* How can we solve this problem?
* What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
* How am I supposed to do that?

The implication of any well-designed calibrated question is that you want what the other guy
wants but you need his intelligence to overcome the problem. This really appeals to very aggressive
or egotistical counterparts

Even with all the best techniques and strategy, you need to regulate your emotions if you
want to have any hope of coming out on top

Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a
goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language.

## Chapter 8: Guarantee Execution

Your job as a negotiator isn’t just to get to an agreement. It’s getting to one
that can be implemented and making sure that happens

The trick to “How” questions is that, correctly used, they are gentle and graceful ways to say
“No” and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution—your solution. 

## Chapter 9: Find the Black Swan

Negotiation breakthroughs—when the game shifts inalterably in your favor—are created by those
who can identify and utilize Black Swans.

Types of Leverage:

* **Positive Leverage**: Your ability as a negotiator to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart wants.
* **Negative Leverage**: You can tell your counterpart, “If you don’t fulfill your commitment/pay your bill/etc., I will destroy your reputation.”
* **Normative Leverage**: Using the other party’s norms and standards to advance your position

* Review everything you hear. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with your team members. You will often discover new information that will help you advance the negotiation.
* Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss.

People respond favorably to requests made in a reasonable tone of voice and followed with a “because” reason.

Common reasons negotiators mistakenly call their counterparts crazy:

1. Other side is ill-informed
2. Other side is constrained
3. They have other interests

# Impossible to Ignore by Carmen Simon

## Chapter 1: Memory is a Means to an End

People act on what they remember, not on what they forget

To be on people’s minds, you must become part of their reflexes, habits, and/or goals they consider valuable.

When there is too much novelty but no integration with existing reflexes and habits, as well as no reinforcement and no immediate rewards, forgetting is inevitable.

Establish a framework, and then decide which items must stand out. Weaken their neighbors.

## Chapter 2: A Business Approach to Memory

60 to 80% of our memory problems are related to forgetting to execute on a future intention
 
The sooner we identify people’s existing intentions or clarify a new intention they would benefit from having, the better we can plan on how to be part of their memories.

When peple act on future intentions they:

1.   Notice cues that are linked to their intentions
2.   Search their memory for something related to those cues and intentions
3.   And if something is rewarding enough … execute

The effectiveness of cues depends on how strongly they are related to a desired intention and how salient they are to draw attention at the time of remembering.

When you are no longer in the room with your listeners, what type of cues will be available in their lives to trigger the appropriate memory and entice them to act? 

Are you making it clear how your content enables others to move toward something rewarding, such as accomplishments, affiliation, efficiency, excitement of discovery, prominence, or freedom from worry?

People execute on intentions according to the following variables tied to rewards: effort, time delay, risk, and social aspects.

## Chapter 3: Control what your audience remembers

There is the opportunity for a small percentage, “10%”, to become part of our audiences’ long-term memory, and it is important not to leave it to chance.

People don’t remember what we say; they remember what they think we say

We are not on people’s minds with the intensity or frequency we think we are.

## Chapter 4: Made You Look

Constantly ask at Point A: Am I showing my audiences a cue that attracts attention in a similar way to what they will see on their own?

Take a look at an important message you want to communicate. Can you place it in a spot where your audience is habitually hanging out?

Provide your audience with cues to focus on specific thoughts, and link those thoughts to your message.

- Reactivate old memories

* “Remember what happened when …”
* “What surprised you most?”
* “What was the most fulfilling part of it?”

- Note relationships between concepts

* “What is the connection between your CMO and the IT department?”

- Elaborate on something they learned in the past

* “What did you notice after your last campaign?”
* “What will you do differently as a result of this experience?”

- Derive meaning

* “What happened that contradicted your prior beliefs?”
* “What does that suggest about your values?”
* “What did the experience teach you about your strengths?”

Link your message to a human need, and you will earn attention.

Can you find a word or term that only you’re associated with in your listeners’ brains?

Tie your message to a current but unfulfilled goal. People tend to pay greater attention to and remember more of what is not finished because the brain seeks closure.

## Chapter 5: The Paradox of Surprise

Surprise was the single most reliable predictor of staying on people’s minds long enough for them to act in our favor.

What do your listeners find familiar, and what are they prone to receiving without skepticism? The link to something that confirms their mental schema and alleviates threats buys you a few more minutes of their attention.

Link your content to uplifting associations.

Juxtapose seemingly unrelated but existing schemas to create surprise.

## Chapter 6: Sweet Anticipation

Something always happens next. Can you get others excited about it?

Using the word “imagine” is a powerful way to create anticipation and emotion. Picture the messages below:

* Imagine a world where every child owns a microscope.
* Imagine getting rid of all the surveillance devices around you.

Dopamine spikes in anticipation of rewards.

Help people convert the prediction of a reward into the motivation to go get it.

Mix Predictability with Novelty

Provide sweet anticipation, not an agonizing wait.

## Chapter 7: What makes a message repeatable?

Any time you aspire to a repeatable message, ask whether your audience can carry your content from context to context. 

For a good mission or vision:
* You cannot remain indifferent to it; it helps you define yourself in relation to it or even in opposition to it.
* The more you think you know it by hearing about it, the more original, unexpected, and innovative you find it when you actually read it.

Have distinct words tied to a simple syntax.

Disfluency deepens information processing.

Repeatable messages are aspirational.

Criteria for repeatable messages:

* Portable
* Timeless
* Simple syntax
* Tied to long-term goals
* Aspirational
* Generic (no articulate prepositions or definite articles)
* Appeal to self-interest (make us look good to ourselves)
* Social currency (make us look good to others)
* Universal

## Chapter 8: Become memorable with distnction

The more similar things are, the harder it will be to retrieve them later. However, similarity is important for the brain to detect distinctiveness.

The brain is constantly looking for rewards. In business, when many messages are the same, we can create distinctiveness, and therefore improve recall, by being specific about these rewards, which we can frame as tangible results.
 
The more an item differs from other items, the bigger its effect. Select a property you want to isolate and increase its distinctiveness by at least 30% compared with neighboring items.
 
## Chapter 9: "I write this sitting in the kitchen sink"

A picture is memorable when it is easy to label, and text is memorable when it is easy to picture.

The emotions when we:

1.   Move toward rewards: pleasure, happiness, elation, ecstasy, love, sexual arousal, trust, empathy, beauty
2.   Move away from rewards: frustration, indignation, disbelief, sadness, anger, rage
3.   Move away from punishments: relief, liberation
4.   Move toward punishments: apprehension, disgust, aversion, fear, terror, unfairness, inequity, uncertainty, social exclusion

People become cynical when:

* Expected outcomes created by an organization are unevenly distributed (e.g., high executive compensation and low raises for the staff).
* People with lesser skills are promoted.
* There are harsh layoffs.
* Expectations are unrealistically high.
* Communication is inadequate.
* Management is characterized by mediocrity.
* Role ambiguity and conflict are prevalent in the workplace.
* People are suffering from work overload.

Something is concrete if we can perceive it with our senses. If we can’t perceive it with our senses, we are talking about an idea or a concept, which is abstract. Balance both in your communication and, to avoid habituation, break the pattern an audience learns to expect.

Avoid clichéd images. Instead, use vivid images to evoke tension, mystery, wabi-sabi, or nostalgia.

Use visual metaphors to explain abstract concepts. Steer away from clichéd metaphors by either giving an old metaphor a fresh meaning or using unexpected metaphors.

## Chapter 10: How much content is too much?

Keep it brief when an audience must identify with the content. Offer more when your listeners don’t have much information or context, and they must make an important decision.

Earn the right to provide more information by offering value.

If your content is long, alter your audience’s perception of time by offering visible signs of progress, shifting the audience’s focus frequently, and making the content aesthetically pleasing.

## Chapter 11: How does the brain decide?

Use these guidelines to make it easier for your audiences’ brains to decide in your favor:

1.   Design cues that are hard to miss, and link them to something rewarding.
2.   Create anticipation, which releases dopamine and sparks action.
3.   Make important messages easy to repeat and recall later.
4.   Ensure that important content comes to mind easily by making it distinct from other content.
5.   Use effective storytelling with a proper combination of perceptive, cognitive, and affective components.
6.   Offer an optimal amount of information.

Habits are formed by doing, not by not doing. Frame your messages in a positive way.

The values our audiences assign to different objects, people, and experiences can range from functional and concrete to something more abstract. People buy things because of emotional, epistemological, aesthetic, hedonistic, or situational value. Clarify these values for your audiences.

Variables that have an impact on our choices include effort to get the reward (physical, financial, or mental), time delay until we get the reward, perception of risk in getting the reward, and social impact in relation to that reward.

If your audiences perceive a high amount of uncertainty in their interactions with you, consider heuristics, such as availability, familiarity, or authority, to help them make quick decisions.

# New Power Notes
# Book by Henry Timms

## Chapter 1

Old power models ask of us only that we comply (pay your taxes, do your homework) or consume. New
power models demand and allow for more: that we share ideas, create new content (as on YouTube) or assets (as on Etsy), even shape a community (think of the sprawling digital movements resisting the Trump presidency).

People, leaders, and
organizations who flourish will be those best able to channel the participatory energy of
those around them

## Chapter 2

Open innovation is the concept of enlisting the crowd to help solve your problem.

Not only did the crowd produce quicker solutions, at much lower
cost, the quality of its work was significantly higher than expected.

The twentieth century was built from the top down. Society was imagined as a great
machine, intricately powered by big bureaucracies and great corporations.

Young people have a new expectation: an inalienable right to participate.

New power is about rewarding those who share their own assets or ideas, spread those of others,
or build on existing ideas to make them better

Old power considers success a zero-sum equation.

New power thinkers demand openness from institutions as a default

Edelman Trust Barometer has measured significantly increasing trust in “people like me,” which has reached higher
levels than public trust in academic experts or doctors

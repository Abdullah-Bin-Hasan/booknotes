# New Power Notes
# Book by Henry Timms

## Chapter 1

Old power models ask of us only that we comply (pay your taxes, do your homework) or consume. New
power models demand and allow for more: that we share ideas, create new content (as on YouTube) or assets (as on Etsy), even shape a community (think of the sprawling digital movements resisting the Trump presidency).

People, leaders, and
organizations who flourish will be those best able to channel the participatory energy of
those around them

# The Fourth Transformation

## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Introduction

The user interface will move from a screen you tap to computer-generated images that you actually touch and feel.

The Fourth Transformation is all about virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (MR)

## Part One: Game Changers

## Chapter 1: What Zuck Saw

VR glasses such Sony PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets immerse
users in artificial worlds. 

Mixed reality, such as what Microsoft HoloLens and Meta 2 offer, integrates
computer-generated images with what is really there so well that it is hard to tell them
apart. With AR, you can tell what is real and what is not.

The lenses of smart glasses will look a lot like simple eyeglasses

Point clouds power nearly everything in enhanced reality.

Spatial computing is the concept that computers can learn the
contextual implications of location and the relationships of objects to each other
through point clouds.

Technology is driving people to video because it communicates
more information more easily. The tools have gotten better and cheaper; bandwidth
and storage may remain an irritant, but they are no longer a major barrier.

## Chapter 2: Minecraft Generation

VR has been likened to LSD, except what you see is created by studios, not chemicals

The HTC Vive, the most expensive of the VR devices released so far, sold 15,000
headsets in its first ten minutes of availability, closing its first day of sales with a
significant backlog

By the year 2025, we believe there will be several hundred million people with
either VR headsets or the mixed reality smart glasses

Children can acquire one, two or more languages and speak them
like nativesâ€”providing they learn them before reaching puberty

Games drive innovation. They helped drive adoption of the mouse, computer graphics,
PC sound, chat and online communities.

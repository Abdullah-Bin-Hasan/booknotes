# The Fourth Transformation

## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Introduction

The user interface will move from a screen you tap to computer-generated images that you actually touch and feel.

The Fourth Transformation is all about virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (MR)

## Part One: Game Changers

## Chapter 1: What Zuck Saw

VR glasses such Sony PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets immerse
users in artificial worlds. 

Mixed reality, such as what Microsoft HoloLens and Meta 2 offer, integrates
computer-generated images with what is really there so well that it is hard to tell them
apart. With AR, you can tell what is real and what is not.

The lenses of smart glasses will look a lot like simple eyeglasses

Point clouds power nearly everything in enhanced reality.

Spatial computing is the concept that computers can learn the
contextual implications of location and the relationships of objects to each other
through point clouds.

Technology is driving people to video because it communicates
more information more easily. The tools have gotten better and cheaper; bandwidth
and storage may remain an irritant, but they are no longer a major barrier.

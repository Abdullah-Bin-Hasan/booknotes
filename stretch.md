# Stretch: Unlock the Power of Less and Achieve More than you Ever Imagined by Scott Sonenshein

## Introduction

* Why do some people and organizations succeed with so little, while others fail with so much?
* Why do we get caught up chasing what we don’t have?
* How is it possible to achieve more prosperous organizations, rewarding careers, and fulfilling lives with what’s already in hand?

## Chapter 1: Work with what you've got

We routinely overestimate the importance of acquiring resources but even more significantly underestimate our ability to make more out of those we have

Chasing, and those who frequently rely on it, chasers, orient themselves around acquiring resources, overlooking how to expand what’s already in hand. Rather than focusing on getting more, people and organizations that stretch build more with what they already possess.Rather than focusing on getting more, people and organizations that stretch build more with what they already possess.

People can accomplish incredible, unimagined things by being resourceful in times of need.

There’s going to be a lot of effort involved in always securing the right tool for every job. Most of our time and energy get spent looking for tools and not actually putting nails into walls.

Daniel Norris is a multimillionaire. He could easily afford one of the spacious homes in the neighborhood. He has chosen the Walmart parking spot not because he’s a vagrant but because it puts him in the right head space to stretch to achieve his life’s dreams.

Silver medalists focused more on what they had failed to accomplish (win gold) compared to bronze medalists. In contrast, the bronze medalists who finished behind the silver winners focused on what they did accomplish (winning a medal).

Upward social comparisons are dangerous when they focus on the allotment of others’ resources, emphasizing what others have and leaving us feeling less than adequate.

The more time people spent using Facebook, the worse they felt, and suggest that the decrease in happiness comes from upward social comparisons.

Functional fixedness—an inability to use a resource beyond the traditional approach. It turns out that as we grow older, we become even more tied to social conventions, making it that much more difficult to envision what we have beyond their common uses.
 
Tven though mindless accumulation led the uncapped group to get more chocolate, they had lower levels of satisfaction, both while earning the chocolate and eating the chocolate.

The American dream carves out a very narrow path to well-being. It sets expectations and shapes behaviors in ways that convince people to chase after things they might not need or want, while overlooking the costs of this pursuit.

Chasing sets such high aspirations that it leaves people perpetually disappointed, especially when compared to the success of someone else. People work hard for the wrong reasons—and are worse off for it.

When people have high personal responsibility for a project, they escalate their commitment to the project by investing additional resources to try to turn things around, even if offered more promising options instead.

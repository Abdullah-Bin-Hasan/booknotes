# Stretch: Unlock the Power of Less and Achieve More than you Ever Imagined by Scott Sonenshein

## Introduction

* Why do some people and organizations succeed with so little, while others fail with so much?
* Why do we get caught up chasing what we don’t have?
* How is it possible to achieve more prosperous organizations, rewarding careers, and fulfilling lives with what’s already in hand?

## Chapter 1: Work with what you've got

We routinely overestimate the importance of acquiring resources but even more significantly underestimate our ability to make more out of those we have

Chasing, and those who frequently rely on it, chasers, orient themselves around acquiring resources, overlooking how to expand what’s already in hand. Rather than focusing on getting more, people and organizations that stretch build more with what they already possess.Rather than focusing on getting more, people and organizations that stretch build more with what they already possess.

People can accomplish incredible, unimagined things by being resourceful in times of need.

There’s going to be a lot of effort involved in always securing the right tool for every job. Most of our time and energy get spent looking for tools and not actually putting nails into walls.

Daniel Norris is a multimillionaire. He could easily afford one of the spacious homes in the neighborhood. He has chosen the Walmart parking spot not because he’s a vagrant but because it puts him in the right head space to stretch to achieve his life’s dreams. 

Success blinds us and reinforces what made us successful in the first place. 

The world around us always moves even when we stand still in complacency. Our once valuable resources—an in-demand skill, a high-performing team, a unique product, and the best mechanical calculator—can quickly become worthless.
 
## Chapter 2: The causes and consequences of a chasing mindset

Silver medalists focused more on what they had failed to accomplish (win gold) compared to bronze medalists. In contrast, the bronze medalists who finished behind the silver winners focused on what they did accomplish (winning a medal).

Upward social comparisons are dangerous when they focus on the allotment of others’ resources, emphasizing what others have and leaving us feeling less than adequate.

The more time people spent using Facebook, the worse they felt, and suggest that the decrease in happiness comes from upward social comparisons.

Functional fixedness—an inability to use a resource beyond the traditional approach. It turns out that as we grow older, we become even more tied to social conventions, making it that much more difficult to envision what we have beyond their common uses.

The American dream carves out a very narrow path to well-being. It sets expectations and shapes behaviors in ways that convince people to chase after things they might not need or want, while overlooking the costs of this pursuit.

Chasing sets such high aspirations that it leaves people perpetually disappointed, especially when compared to the success of someone else. People work hard for the wrong reasons—and are worse off for it.

When people have high personal responsibility for a project, they escalate their commitment to the project by investing additional resources to try to turn things around, even if offered more promising options instead.

## Chapter 3: The Basics and Benefits of a stretching mind-set

A stretching mind-set releases us from the anxiety of never having enough and teaches us that we can make more than enough with what’s right here.

By believing that we control our resources, we allow ourselves to work with them in expansive and inventive ways.

When people feel a sense of ownership, they are far more satisfied with their jobs. In a sample of diverse professionals ranging from accountants to software engineers, psychological ownership accounted for 16 percent of a person’s job satisfaction. Psychological ownership and owner-like behaviors predicted improved financial performance

When people face scarcity, they give themselves freedom to use resources in less conventional ways.


1. Frugal people emphasize long-term objectives over short-term pleasures
2. Frugal people reuse what they have instead of buying more.
3. Frugal people feel freer from conventions, making them less susceptible to social comparisons that lead to chasing. They avoid fretting over what they don’t have and instead carve out a path using what they do have.


## Chapter 4: The Value of Knowing A Little About a Lot

An outsider can regularly outperform experts in solving a problem in their own area of expertise, especially for complex challenges. The key to outsiders’ results lies with the diversity of their experience.

For fields without stable rules, thousands of hours of practice turn out to be less relevant because the rules constantly shift.

A doctor treated a patient with an ache in the right ear. The doctor’s sloppily written instructions were to put eardrops in the patient’s “R ear.” The nurse promptly put eardrops into the patient’s rear end. The patient complied, believing that despite the unusual treatment for an earache, the experts obviously knew what they were doing.

People who knew lots of little things and drew from multiple perspectives routinely outperformed those who knew one big thing really well.

A diversity of experiences allows people to think more expansively about their resources, leading to more divergent ways of approaching problems. 

How do you take your resources to new places?

1. Explore the world around you ("To invent you need a good imagination and a pile of junk")
2. Make sure resources remain accessible and at the top of your mind
3. Use analogical reasoning
4. Regularly test ideas, expecting most to fail

The more diverse the non-work experiences, the more resourceful people were at work.

## Chapter 5: Time to Act

The biggest determination of our performance is what we do and not what we plan to do. Too much planning prevents us from acting.

There’s less politically, psychologically, and economically invested when not following a plan, enabling us to be responsive to whatever up-to-date information we have instead of overly committed to staying the course

We often give credit for our success to our professional and personal maps—our plans—it’s our actions that usually explain our results. 

Planning bred anxiety from always worrying about following the plan, and then second-guessing whether it was even the best plan.

We don’t always need a complete script . . . or even one at all. Instead, we just need to call, “Action!”

## Chapter 6: We are what we expect

The expectations we set, and that others set for us, are critical for our prospects. Even when based on a false belief, they have a substantial impact on our professional achievements and personal well-being

A manager’s expectations can change an employee’s performance 

Madame C. J. Walker became America’s first black woman millionaire and left an estate worth about $8 million

When we label the same challenges as an opportunity, we approach them very differently.

In some settings, we’re more prone to expect the worst, especially from other people. And when we expect the worst, that’s what we usually get.

# Actionable Gamification by Yu-Kai Chou

## Chapter 1: When the Surreal Blends into our World

1. How to make games more meaningful?
2. How to make life more fun?

Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at their chosen sport or recreational pursuit than they would work at a job where they were being paid

* Clearly defined goals
* Better scorekeeping and scorecards
* More frequent feedback
* A higher degree of personal choice of methods
* Consistent coaching

## Chapter 2: The PBL Fallacy

Many gamification professionals seem to believe that if you put points on something boring, add some badges, and provide a competitive leaderboard, that once
boring product will automatically become exciting.

Simply incorporating game mechanics and game elements does not make a game fun.

The good game designer may begin by thinking, “Okay,
how do I want my users to feel? Do I want them to feel inspired? Do I want them to feel proud?
Should they be scared? Anxious? What’s my goal for their intended experience?

## Chapter 3: The Octalysis Framework

**The 8 Core Drives of Gamification**

1. Epic Meaning & Calling
2. Development & Accomplishment
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
4. Ownership & Possession
5. Social Influence & Relatedness
6. Scarcity & Impatience
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity
8. Loss & Avoidance

The first application of Octalysis is to use it in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various
products and experiences with respect to motivation.

Easy: Think of a game that you have enjoyed playing for a very long time. Can you identify which of
the 8 Core Drives are present in the game?

Medium: Think about why you are reading this book. What Core Drives have motivated you to read
this book over other activities?

## Chapter 4: Putting Gamification in its Place

Serious games and advergames should actually be included in gamification, as they are
utilizing game design to achieve a non-game productive result.

A tomato is biologically classified as a fruit, but is culinarily treated as a vegetable.

*Explicit Gamification* involves strategies that utilize applications that are obviously game-like. Users
acknowledge they are playing a game, and generally need to opt into playing.

*Implicit Gamification* is a form of design that subtly employs gamification techniques and the 8 Core
Drives of Octalysis into the user experience. Implicit Gamification techniques are filled with game
design elements that are sometimes even invisible to the user

Types of gamification:
* Product Gamification
* Workplace Gamification
* Marketing Gamification
* Lifestyle Gamification

24% of the workforce is categorized as “Actively Disengaged,”
which means they are so unhappy with their work that they minimize their productivity, spread
negativity, and even sabotage productive efforts that require them to do more work to keep their jobs.

Easy: Think about what areas in your life that you would like gamification to help you improve. Is it
Product, Workplace, Marketing, or Lifestyle Gamification?

Medium: Identify a gamification example you have encountered before. Is it Explicit or Implicit
Gamification? What are the pros and cons for using that type of implementation?

## Chapter 5: The First Core Drive - Epic Meaning & Calling

This is the drive where people are motivated because they believe they are engaged in something bigger than themselves.

Individuals participate in the system and take action not because it
necessarily benefits them, but because they can then see themselves as heroes of a grander story. It’s
about playing your part for the greater good.

Besides offering stellar products with elegant design and meticulous engineering, Apple has been one
of the few electronics companies that actually try to sell a higher meaning.

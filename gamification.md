# Actionable Gamification by Yu-Kai Chou

## Chapter 1: When the Surreal Blends into our World

1. How to make games more meaningful?
2. How to make life more fun?

Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at their chosen sport or recreational pursuit than they would work at a job where they were being paid

* Clearly defined goals
* Better scorekeeping and scorecards
* More frequent feedback
* A higher degree of personal choice of methods
* Consistent coaching

## Chapter 2: The PBL Fallacy

Many gamification professionals seem to believe that if you put points on something boring, add some badges, and provide a competitive leaderboard, that once
boring product will automatically become exciting.

Simply incorporating game mechanics and game elements does not make a game fun.

The good game designer may begin by thinking, “Okay,
how do I want my users to feel? Do I want them to feel inspired? Do I want them to feel proud?
Should they be scared? Anxious? What’s my goal for their intended experience?

## Chapter 3: The Octalysis Framework

**The 8 Core Drives of Gamification**

1. Epic Meaning & Calling
2. Development & Accomplishment
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
4. Ownership & Possession
5. Social Influence & Relatedness
6. Scarcity & Impatience
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity
8. Loss & Avoidance

The first application of Octalysis is to use it in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various
products and experiences with respect to motivation.

Easy: Think of a game that you have enjoyed playing for a very long time. Can you identify which of
the 8 Core Drives are present in the game?

Medium: Think about why you are reading this book. What Core Drives have motivated you to read
this book over other activities?

## Chapter 4: Putting Gamification in its Place

Serious games and advergames should actually be included in gamification, as they are
utilizing game design to achieve a non-game productive result.

A tomato is biologically classified as a fruit, but is culinarily treated as a vegetable.

*Explicit Gamification* involves strategies that utilize applications that are obviously game-like. Users
acknowledge they are playing a game, and generally need to opt into playing.

*Implicit Gamification* is a form of design that subtly employs gamification techniques and the 8 Core
Drives of Octalysis into the user experience. Implicit Gamification techniques are filled with game
design elements that are sometimes even invisible to the user

Types of gamification:
* Product Gamification
* Workplace Gamification
* Marketing Gamification
* Lifestyle Gamification

24% of the workforce is categorized as “Actively Disengaged,”
which means they are so unhappy with their work that they minimize their productivity, spread
negativity, and even sabotage productive efforts that require them to do more work to keep their jobs.

Easy: Think about what areas in your life that you would like gamification to help you improve. Is it
Product, Workplace, Marketing, or Lifestyle Gamification?

Medium: Identify a gamification example you have encountered before. Is it Explicit or Implicit
Gamification? What are the pros and cons for using that type of implementation?

## Chapter 5: The First Core Drive - Epic Meaning & Calling

This is the drive where people are motivated because they believe they are engaged in something bigger than themselves.

Individuals participate in the system and take action not because it
necessarily benefits them, but because they can then see themselves as heroes of a grander story. It’s
about playing your part for the greater good.

Besides offering stellar products with elegant design and meticulous engineering, Apple has been one
of the few electronics companies that actually try to sell a higher meaning.

## Chapter 6: The Second Core Drive - Development & Accomplishment

This is the Core Drive where people are driven by a sense of growth and a need to
accomplish a targeted goal.

By adding that extra step of throwing in an egg yourself for betty crocker, people felt that they were actually baking a delicious dessert to compliment a meal.

The average consumer prefers and trusts reviews by peers over those by professional critics

If a user spends four seconds on an interface and can’t figure out what to do, they feel stupid and will start to disengage emotionally

People do not take actions that are necessarily the most economical, but actions that make them feel the smartest

When we see a progress bar that is taunting us as only being 70% of a human being, it gives us that extra push to finish the Desired
Actions and achieve the Win-State of completeness.

The Rockstar Effect is a gamification design technique where you make users feel like everyone is
dying to interact with them. 

*Urgent Optimism* is where the user feels optimistic that they can accomplish the task, but also the urgeny to act immediately.

**Easy**: Think of an example where Core Drive 2: Development & Accomplishment motivated you or
others to take certain actions. Did it keep people engaged for longer?

**Medium**: Think of the last time you saw a points or achievement symbol system. Were the points or
achievement symbols representing something meaningful? Or were they pointless? What would you
change to make them represent a sense of true progress and accomplishment?

**Hard**: For your own project, create a Status Points and Achievement Symbol economy via
spreadsheets. Define what the Desired Actions are, assign point values to these actions based on how
meaningful they are to the user, and assign Achievement Symbols based on more creative factors
beyond just “Woot! You did the action a hundred times!”

## Chapter 7: The Third Core Drive - Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback

Students who played Starcraft roughly an hour a day improved their memory, visual
search and informational filtering abilities, as well as other cognitive skills 

When you design a great gamified system, you want to make sure that there isn’t one
standard way to win. Instead, provide users with enough meaningful choices that they can utilize
drastically different ways to better express their creativity, while still achieving the Win-State.

Studies have shown that people like something more when they are given a choice, compared
to simply having one option. This holds true even if the multiple options are not as appealing
compared to the single choice

**Easy**: Think of an example where Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity motivated you or others
to take certain actions. Did it keep people engaged for longer?

**Medium**: Think of the last time you were engaged in an activity that really drew you in. Did it involve
a lot of creativity, strategy, or meaningful choices? If yes, describe the process in which these
elements were brought out. If not, think of ways to add these components into the experience. Would
that make the activity even more engaging?

**Medium**: For your own project, think of ways you can implement Milestone Unlocks into the
experience, while rewarding the users with Boosters once they hit the milestone. Are the Boosters
something that users will see in a favorable light because it allows them to do what they desire to do,
but more efficiently? Or is it something that users will perceive as a controlling tool to make what
you want more efficient without caring about their own interests?

## Chapter 8: The Fourth Core Drive - Ownership & Possession

This Core Drive involves many elements such as virtual goods and virtual currencies, but it is also
the primary drive that compels us to collect stamps or accumulate wealth

People are much more likely to choose careers that sound similar to their own names

Studies have even shown that we prefer brands and even spouses that remind us of our own names

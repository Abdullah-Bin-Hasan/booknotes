# Actionable Gamification by Yu-Kai Chou

## Chapter 1: When the Surreal Blends into our World

1. How to make games more meaningful?
2. How to make life more fun?

Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at their chosen sport or recreational pursuit than they would work at a job where they were being paid

* Clearly defined goals
* Better scorekeeping and scorecards
* More frequent feedback
* A higher degree of personal choice of methods
* Consistent coaching

## Chapter 2: The PBL Fallacy

Many gamification professionals seem to believe that if you put points on something boring, add some badges, and provide a competitive leaderboard, that once
boring product will automatically become exciting.

Simply incorporating game mechanics and game elements does not make a game fun.

The good game designer may begin by thinking, “Okay,
how do I want my users to feel? Do I want them to feel inspired? Do I want them to feel proud?
Should they be scared? Anxious? What’s my goal for their intended experience?

## Chapter 3: The Octalysis Framework

**The 8 Core Drives of Gamification**

1. Epic Meaning & Calling
2. Development & Accomplishment
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
4. Ownership & Possession
5. Social Influence & Relatedness
6. Scarcity & Impatience
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity
8. Loss & Avoidance

The first application of Octalysis is to use it in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various
products and experiences with respect to motivation.

Easy: Think of a game that you have enjoyed playing for a very long time. Can you identify which of
the 8 Core Drives are present in the game?

Medium: Think about why you are reading this book. What Core Drives have motivated you to read
this book over other activities?

## Chapter 4: Putting Gamification in its Place

Serious games and advergames should actually be included in gamification, as they are
utilizing game design to achieve a non-game productive result.

A tomato is biologically classified as a fruit, but is culinarily treated as a vegetable.

*Explicit Gamification* involves strategies that utilize applications that are obviously game-like. Users
acknowledge they are playing a game, and generally need to opt into playing.

*Implicit Gamification* is a form of design that subtly employs gamification techniques and the 8 Core
Drives of Octalysis into the user experience. Implicit Gamification techniques are filled with game
design elements that are sometimes even invisible to the user

Types of gamification:
* Product Gamification
* Workplace Gamification
* Marketing Gamification
* Lifestyle Gamification

24% of the workforce is categorized as “Actively Disengaged,”
which means they are so unhappy with their work that they minimize their productivity, spread
negativity, and even sabotage productive efforts that require them to do more work to keep their jobs.

Easy: Think about what areas in your life that you would like gamification to help you improve. Is it
Product, Workplace, Marketing, or Lifestyle Gamification?

Medium: Identify a gamification example you have encountered before. Is it Explicit or Implicit
Gamification? What are the pros and cons for using that type of implementation?

## Chapter 5: The First Core Drive - Epic Meaning & Calling

This is the drive where people are motivated because they believe they are engaged in something bigger than themselves.

Individuals participate in the system and take action not because it
necessarily benefits them, but because they can then see themselves as heroes of a grander story. It’s
about playing your part for the greater good.

Besides offering stellar products with elegant design and meticulous engineering, Apple has been one
of the few electronics companies that actually try to sell a higher meaning.

## Chapter 6: The Second Core Drive - Development & Accomplishment

This is the Core Drive where people are driven by a sense of growth and a need to
accomplish a targeted goal.

By adding that extra step of throwing in an egg yourself for betty crocker, people felt that they were actually baking a delicious dessert to compliment a meal.

The average consumer prefers and trusts reviews by peers over those by professional critics

If a user spends four seconds on an interface and can’t figure out what to do, they feel stupid and will start to disengage emotionally

People do not take actions that are necessarily the most economical, but actions that make them feel the smartest

When we see a progress bar that is taunting us as only being 70% of a human being, it gives us that extra push to finish the Desired
Actions and achieve the Win-State of completeness.

The Rockstar Effect is a gamification design technique where you make users feel like everyone is
dying to interact with them. 

*Urgent Optimism* is where the user feels optimistic that they can accomplish the task, but also the urgeny to act immediately.

**Easy**: Think of an example where Core Drive 2: Development & Accomplishment motivated you or
others to take certain actions. Did it keep people engaged for longer?

**Medium**: Think of the last time you saw a points or achievement symbol system. Were the points or
achievement symbols representing something meaningful? Or were they pointless? What would you
change to make them represent a sense of true progress and accomplishment?

**Hard**: For your own project, create a Status Points and Achievement Symbol economy via
spreadsheets. Define what the Desired Actions are, assign point values to these actions based on how
meaningful they are to the user, and assign Achievement Symbols based on more creative factors
beyond just “Woot! You did the action a hundred times!”

## Chapter 7: The Third Core Drive - Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback

Students who played Starcraft roughly an hour a day improved their memory, visual
search and informational filtering abilities, as well as other cognitive skills 

When you design a great gamified system, you want to make sure that there isn’t one
standard way to win. Instead, provide users with enough meaningful choices that they can utilize
drastically different ways to better express their creativity, while still achieving the Win-State.

Studies have shown that people like something more when they are given a choice, compared
to simply having one option. This holds true even if the multiple options are not as appealing
compared to the single choice

**Easy**: Think of an example where Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity motivated you or others
to take certain actions. Did it keep people engaged for longer?

**Medium**: Think of the last time you were engaged in an activity that really drew you in. Did it involve
a lot of creativity, strategy, or meaningful choices? If yes, describe the process in which these
elements were brought out. If not, think of ways to add these components into the experience. Would
that make the activity even more engaging?

**Medium**: For your own project, think of ways you can implement Milestone Unlocks into the
experience, while rewarding the users with Boosters once they hit the milestone. Are the Boosters
something that users will see in a favorable light because it allows them to do what they desire to do,
but more efficiently? Or is it something that users will perceive as a controlling tool to make what
you want more efficient without caring about their own interests?

## Chapter 8: The Fourth Core Drive - Ownership & Possession

This Core Drive involves many elements such as virtual goods and virtual currencies, but it is also
the primary drive that compels us to collect stamps or accumulate wealth

People are much more likely to choose careers that sound similar to their own names

Studies have even shown that we prefer brands and even spouses that remind us of our own names

When you create a product or service, it is often desirable for your users to increase their vested
ownership in the process of its creation. This is why it is useful to have them involved in the
development process early on – to “build from scratch.”

This means that users should never feel like the exchangeable currency or goods are
excessively abundant

Monitor Attachment is a game technique that allows people to develop more ownership towards
something, such that they are constantly monitoring or paying attention to it.

**Easy**: Think about something you collected or had a unique sense of ownership with. Did you feel
that it was “fun” to spend time with it, even though from an outsider’s perspective it could look like
you weren’t doing anything with it?

**Easy**: Think about something that has the Alfred Effect in your life. How did they implement it, and
when did you recognize that effect was in place? Could it be designed to let users become aware of it
sooner?

**Medium**: Think about how you can introduce a Collection Set into a project that you are currently
working on which will motivate users towards the Desired Actions. What kind of theme(s) can the
collection set use? Do you want each piece to be given as an Earned Lunch whenever the user
commits the Desired Actions, or have it as a Mystery Box where the pieces come out randomly after
the Desired Actions?

## Chapter 9: The Fifth Core Drive - Social Influence & Relatedness

This Core Drive is the engine behind many themes such as mentorship, competition, envy, group quests, social treasure, and companionship.

What we perceive as the social norm greatly influences our decisions and behavior, often more so than personal gains or even moral standards. 

When you are leading a team, never lose sight of that Epic Meaning & Calling.

When we implement competition in the workplace, we need to thoughtfully analyze the risks as well
as the benefits, in determining whether there might be any significant and long-term harm to the
employees and ultimately the enterprise

**When competition works**:

* In situations where players aim to achieve mastery of the task
* In gain-oriented scenarios and mindsets where players focus on becoming the winner
* When contestants reach their Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF), which means their anxiety and arousal level reaches a heightened degree of focus
* When players care about the welfare of the team
* When players are primed to overcome obstacles, and not what they will do after reaching the goal
* With situational anger to confrontations
* When there is an even matchup and players feel that they actually have a chance
* When players care about the competitors (competing against your friends instead of every stranger in the world)

**Competition does not work**:

* In learning-focused environments
* In prevention-oriented situations and attitudes where players focus on not being the loser
* When teams are too harmonious and competition becomes awkward
* When creativity is required
* When the competition is regarded as skewed and there is little chance to win

**Easy**: Think of a time when you had a mentor. Did your behavior change because of the mentor? If
you haven’t never had a mentor before, come up with a plan to obtain one.

**Easy**: Think about a Social Treasure you received, or a Social Treasure that you were asked to give.
Was it designed to encourage applicants to spread the name of a brand or project?

**Medium**: Think about another example that heavily utilized Conformity Anchors to change behavior.
How was it utilized and can it be improved?

**Hard**: Think about how you can implement a Group Quest into the project you are doing right now
that will motivate users towards the Desired Actions. Does it have a theme? Could it utilize
collection sets and boosters to become even more engaging?

## Chapter 10: The Sixth Core Drive: Scarcity & Impatience

We buy things not because of their actual value, but rather based on their perceived value, which means many times our purchases aren’t very rational.

When there is a perceived abundance, motivation starts to dwindle

If you are always leaving the discussions, it means that you are not desperate,
are highly sought after, and not dependent on this deal. You are the Prize. Klaff claims that, when you
correctly do this, money will flow in.

Magnetic Caps are limitations placed on how many times a user can commit certain Desired Actions,
which then stimulates more motivation to commit them.

A Torture Break is a sudden and often triggered pause to the Desired Actions.

**Easy**: Think about a time where you wanted something, mostly because it was exclusive, or because
you felt you were uniquely qualified. Try to describe the nature of that feeling from Scarcity &
Impatience.

**Medium**: Think about a time when a company attempted to implement a corny form of Scarcity, and it
backfired because it caused people to go into denial. What could the company do to actually
implement principles of Scarcity correctly?

**Hard**: Think about how you can implement combinations of Dangling, Torture Breaks, Evolved UI,
and Anchored Juxtaposition into one of your own projects. Does it automatically increase the desire
for other Core Drives? Or does it hamper it? Does it drive long-term engagement, or short-term
obsession?

## Chapter 11: The Seventh Core Drive - Unpredictability & Curiosity

It is important to give a pitch that continuously serves unexpected and unpredictable information to keep people engaged.

Being “lucky” in a scenario of chance can install a higher sense of mission and purpose.

The Glowing Choice technique is about applying an overlay item that shines like a bright star in the midst of a complex environment.

Sudden rewards incentivize customers to keep coming back in the hopes that they can inadvertently feel the same bliss again.

The reason why lotteries work so well is because our brains are incredibly bad at distinguishing
small percentages.

**Easy**: Think about your favorite TV-series (if you have one) that you are constantly glued to. Once
you watched it through once, would you go back and watch it again alone? What happens to your
motivation when Unpredictability diminishes?

**Medium**: Unpredictability magnifies our emotions towards both gain (Core Drive 4) and Loss (Core
Drive 8). Think about a scenario where unpredictability was attached to a gain and it made the entire
experience more playful and exciting compared to a guaranteed chance of gain. Then, think about a
scenario where it is tied to a loss and how it paralyzed activity more-so than if the loss had a sure
chance of incurring. Can you see how unpredictability can make any event more emotional engaging
through a Black Hat Intrinsic way?

**Hard**: In your own project, try to design a Group Quest Mystery Box combo, where if the entire group
commits various Desired Actions, a surprise reward will be given to everyone. Evaluate the pros and
cons of that compared to just giving a Group Fix-Action Reward, where everyone already knows
exactly what the reward is if they did the Desired Actions (Earned Lunch).

## Chapter 12: The Eighth Core Drive - Loss & Avoidance

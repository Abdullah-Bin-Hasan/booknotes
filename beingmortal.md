# Being Mortal by Henry Holt

## Introduction

As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did.

The experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes.

You don’t have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help.

## Chapter 1: The independent Self

Health professionals have a formal classification system for the level of function a person has. If you cannot, without assistance, use the toilet, eat, dress, bathe, groom, get out of bed, get out of a chair, and walk—the eight “Activities of Daily Living”—then you lack the capacity for basic physical independence. If you cannot shop for yourself, prepare your own food, maintain your housekeeping, do your laundry, manage your medications, make phone calls, travel on your own, and handle your finances—the eight “Independent Activities of Daily Living”—then you lack the capacity to live safely on your own.

Elders were cared for in multigenerational systems, often with three generations living under one roof. 
Even when the nuclear family replaced the extended family (as it did in northern Europe several centuries ago), the elderly were not left to cope with the infirmities of age on their own. 
Children typically left home as soon as they were old enough to start families of their own. But one child usually remained, often the youngest daughter, if the parents survived into senescence. 

Old age itself has changed. In the past, surviving into old age was uncommon, and those who did survive served a special purpose as guardians of tradition, knowledge, and history. They tended to maintain their status and authority as heads of the household until death. 

As children departed home for opportunities elsewhere, parents who lived long lives found they could rent or even sell their land instead of handing it down. Rising incomes, and then pension systems, enabled more and more people to accumulate savings and property, allowing them to maintain economic control of their lives in old age and freeing them from the need to work until death or total disability. 

Family sizes fell from an average of seven children in the mid-1800s to just over three after 1900. 

Just 10 percent of Europeans over age eighty live with their children, and almost half live completely alone, without a spouse.

Serious illness or infirmity will strike. It is as inevitable as sunset. And then a new question arises: If independence is what we live for, what do we do when it can no longer be sustained?

## Chapter 2: Things fall apart

For all but our most recent history, death was a common, ever-present possibility. It didn’t matter whether you were five or fifty. Every day was a roll of the dice.

The advances of modern medicine have given us two revolutions: we’ve undergone a biological transformation of the course of our lives and also a cultural transformation of how we think about that course.

Experts say they can gauge a person’s age to within five years from the examination of a single tooth
 
The peak output of the heart therefore decreases steadily from the age of thirty. 

The idea that living things shut down instead of wearing down has received substantial support in recent years.

Only 3 percent of how long you’ll live, compared with the average, is explained by your parents’ longevity; by contrast, up to 90 percent of how tall you are is explained by your parents’ height. Even genetically identical twins vary widely in life span: the typical gap is more than fifteen years.

Although the elderly population is growing rapidly, the number of certified geriatricians the medical profession has put in practice has actually fallen in the United States by 25 percent between 1996 and 2010. fields like plastic surgery and radiology receive applications in record numbers.

If scientists came up with a device—call it an automatic defrailer—that wouldn’t extend your life but would slash the likelihood you’d end up in a nursing home or miserable with depression, we’d be clamoring for it

97 percent of medical students take no course in geriatrics

The risk of a fatal car crash with a driver who’s eighty-five or older is more than three times higher than it is with a teenage driver. 

## Chapter 3: Dependence

Old age is a continuous series of losses.

A 1912 report from the Illinois State Charities Commission described one county’s poorhouse as “unfit to decently house animals.”

A 1909 Virginia report described elderly people dying untended, receiving inadequate nutrition and care, and contracting tuberculosis from uncontrolled contagion. Funds were chronically inadequate for disabled care.

The Guru Vishram Vridh ashram, for instance, is a charity-run old age home in a slum on the south edge of New Delhi, where open sewage ran in the streets and emaciated dogs rummaged in piles of trash.

The most common complaint made is one I’ve heard often from nursing home residents: “It just isn’t home"

Harry Truman, an eighty-three-year-old man who, in March 1980, refused to budge from his home at the foot of Mount Saint Helens near Olympia, Washington, when the volcano began to steam and rumble.

Our old age homes didn’t develop out of a desire to give the frail elderly better lives than they’d had in those dismal places. We said, “This looks like a medical problem. Let’s put these people in the hospital. Maybe the doctors can figure something out.” The modern nursing home developed from there, more or less by accident.

The bureau of Health Insurance's ruling gave an opening to nursing homes, few of which met even minimum federal standards such as having a nurse on-site or fire protections in place. Thousands of them, asserting that they were in “substantial compliance,” were approved, and the number of nursing homes exploded—by 1970, some thirteen thousand of them had been built

Nursing home staff like, and approve of, residents who are “fighters” and show “dignity and self-esteem”—until these traits interfere with the staff’s priorities for them. Then they are “feisty.”

How do we make life worth living when we’re weak and frail and can’t fend for ourselves anymore?

## Chapter 4: Assistance 

Our chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive. 

Postural hypotension is a condition of old age in which the body loses its ability to maintain adequate blood pressure for brain function during changes in position like standing up from sitting.

Taking care of a debilitated, elderly person in our medicalized era is an overwhelming combination of the technological and the custodial.

When Keren Brown Wilson, one of the originators of the concept, built her first assisted living home for the aged in Oregon in the 1980s, she was trying to create a place that would eliminate the need for nursing homes altogether.

Residents of assisted living homes had not traded their health for freedom. Their satisfaction with their lives increased, and at the same time their health was maintained. Their physical and cognitive functioning actually improved. Incidence of major depression fell. And the cost for those on government support was 20 percent lower than it would have been in a nursing home.

Studies find that as people grow older they interact with fewer people and concentrate more on spending time with family and established friends.

People reported more positive emotions as they aged. They became less prone to anxiety, depression, and anger. 

What if the change in needs and desires has nothing to do with age per se? Suppose it merely has to do with perspective—your personal sense of how finite your time in this world is.

In general, the younger the subjects were, the less they valued time with people they were emotionally close to and the more they valued time with people who were potential sources of information or new friendship. However, among the ill, the age differences disappeared. The preferences of a young person with AIDS were the same as those of an old person.

It’s perspective, not age, that matters most.
 
The concept of assisted living became so popular that developers began slapping the name on just about anything. The idea mutated from a radical alternative to nursing homes into a menagerie of watered-down versions with fewer services. Wilson testified before Congress and spoke across the country about her increasing alarm at the way the idea was evolving.
 
 Unless supporting people’s capabilities is made a priority, the staff ends up dressing people like they’re rag dolls. Gradually, that’s how everything begins to go. The tasks come to matter more than the people.
 
It’s the rare child who is able to think, ‘Is this place what Mom would want or like or need?’ It’s more like they’re seeing it through their own lens. The child asks, “Is this a place *I* would be comfortable leaving Mom"?

Our elderly are left with a controlled and supervised institutional existence, a medically designed answer to unfixable problems, a life designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about.

# Chapter 5: A Better Life

What allows you to be a good salesperson is that you have to be willing to be rejected

A good life was one of maximum independence. But that was precisely what the people in nursing homes were denied. 

People in nursing homes are dying of boredom, loneliness, and helplessness 

Royce wanted to understand why simply existing—why being merely housed and fed and safe and alive—seems empty and meaningless to us. What more is it that we need in order to feel that life is worthwhile?
The answer, he believed, is that we all seek a cause beyond ourselves. 

The only way death is not meaningless is to see yourself as part of something greater: a family, a community, a society. 

Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul.
 
Research has found that in units with fewer than twenty people there tends to be less anxiety and depression, more socializing and friendship, an increased sense of safety, and more interaction with staff—even in cases when residents have developed dementia. 

## Chapter 6: Letting Go

More than 15 percent of lung cancers—more than people realize—occur in nonsmokers.

There is no cure for lung cancer at this stage. Even with chemotherapy, the median survival is about a year.

In the United States, 25 percent of all Medicare spending is for the 5 percent of patients who are in their final year of life, and most of that money goes for care in their last couple of months that is of little apparent benefit.

Six months after their death, their caregivers were three times as likely to suffer major depression.

Surveys find that people with serious illness's top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally aware, not being a burden on others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete. 

People believed death should be accepted stoically, without fear or self-pity or hope for anything more than the forgiveness of God. Reaffirming one’s faith, repenting one’s sins, and letting go of one’s worldly possessions and desires were crucial

The difference between standard medical care and hospice is not the difference between treating and doing nothing. The difference was in the priorities. In ordinary medicine, the goal is to extend life. We’ll sacrifice the quality of your existence now—by performing surgery, providing chemotherapy, putting you in intensive care—for the chance of gaining time later. Hospice deploys nurses, doctors, chaplains, and social workers to help people with a fatal illness have the fullest possible lives right now

Sixty-three percent of doctors overestimated their patient’s survival time. Just 17 percent underestimated it. The average estimate was 530 percent too high. And the better the doctors knew their patients, the more likely they were to err.

although doctors usually tell patients when a cancer is not curable, most are reluctant to give a specific prognosis, even when pressed. More than 40 percent of oncologists admit to offering treatments that they believe are unlikely to work. 

It has become, in my view, a bit too trendy to regard the acceptance of death as something tantamount to intrinsic dignity

We’ve created a multitrillion-dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets—and have only the rudiments of a system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win

When there is no way of knowing exactly how long our skeins will run—and when we imagine ourselves to have much more time than we do—our every impulse is to fight, to die with chemo in our veins or a tube in our throats or fresh sutures in our flesh. The fact that we may be shortening or worsening the time we have left hardly seems to register.
 
People who had substantive discussions with their doctor about their end-of-life preferences were far more likely to die at peace and in control of their situation and to spare their family anguish.

Arriving at an acceptance of one’s mortality and a clear understanding of the limits and the possibilities of medicine is a process, not an epiphany.

## Chapter 7: Hard Conversations

Five of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are in Africa. By 2030, one-half to two-thirds of the global population will be middle class.

As incomes rise, private sector health care is increasing rapidly, usually paid for in cash. Doctors everywhere become all too ready to offer false hopes, leading families to empty bank accounts, sell their seed crops, and take money from their children’s education for futile treatments.  Use of hospice care has been growing steadily—to the point that, by 2010, 45 percent of Americans died in hospice.

Patients tend to be optimists, even if that makes them prefer doctors who are more likely to be wrong

We know less and less about our patients but more and more about our science. Overall, this kind of relationship can work beautifully, especially when the choices are clear, the trade-offs are straightforward, and people have clear preferences. 

Understanding the finitude of one’s time could be a gift

You may not control life’s circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.

Life is choices, and they are relentless. No sooner have you made one choice than another is upon you.

## Chapter 8: Courage

Courage is *strength* in the face of knowledge of what is to be feared or hoped. Wisdom is prudent strength

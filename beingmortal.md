# Being Mortal by Henry Holt

## Introduction

As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did.

The experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes.

You don’t have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help.

## Chapter 1: The independent Self

Health professionals have a formal classification system for the level of function a person has. If you cannot, without assistance, use the toilet, eat, dress, bathe, groom, get out of bed, get out of a chair, and walk—the eight “Activities of Daily Living”—then you lack the capacity for basic physical independence. If you cannot shop for yourself, prepare your own food, maintain your housekeeping, do your laundry, manage your medications, make phone calls, travel on your own, and handle your finances—the eight “Independent Activities of Daily Living”—then you lack the capacity to live safely on your own.

Elders were cared for in multigenerational systems, often with three generations living under one roof. 
Even when the nuclear family replaced the extended family (as it did in northern Europe several centuries ago), the elderly were not left to cope with the infirmities of age on their own. 
Children typically left home as soon as they were old enough to start families of their own. But one child usually remained, often the youngest daughter, if the parents survived into senescence. 

Old age itself has changed. In the past, surviving into old age was uncommon, and those who did survive served a special purpose as guardians of tradition, knowledge, and history. They tended to maintain their status and authority as heads of the household until death. 

As children departed home for opportunities elsewhere, parents who lived long lives found they could rent or even sell their land instead of handing it down. Rising incomes, and then pension systems, enabled more and more people to accumulate savings and property, allowing them to maintain economic control of their lives in old age and freeing them from the need to work until death or total disability. 

Family sizes fell from an average of seven children in the mid-1800s to just over three after 1900. 

Just 10 percent of Europeans over age eighty live with their children, and almost half live completely alone, without a spouse.

Serious illness or infirmity will strike. It is as inevitable as sunset. And then a new question arises: If independence is what we live for, what do we do when it can no longer be sustained?

## Chapter 2: Things fall apart

For all but our most recent history, death was a common, ever-present possibility. It didn’t matter whether you were five or fifty. Every day was a roll of the dice.

The advances of modern medicine have given us two revolutions: we’ve undergone a biological transformation of the course of our lives and also a cultural transformation of how we think about that course.

Experts say they can gauge a person’s age to within five years from the examination of a single tooth
 
The peak output of the heart therefore decreases steadily from the age of thirty. 

The idea that living things shut down instead of wearing down has received substantial support in recent years.

Only 3 percent of how long you’ll live, compared with the average, is explained by your parents’ longevity; by contrast, up to 90 percent of how tall you are is explained by your parents’ height. Even genetically identical twins vary widely in life span: the typical gap is more than fifteen years.

Although the elderly population is growing rapidly, the number of certified geriatricians the medical profession has put in practice has actually fallen in the United States by 25 percent between 1996 and 2010. fields like plastic surgery and radiology receive applications in record numbers.

If scientists came up with a device—call it an automatic defrailer—that wouldn’t extend your life but would slash the likelihood you’d end up in a nursing home or miserable with depression, we’d be clamoring for it

97 percent of medical students take no course in geriatrics

The risk of a fatal car crash with a driver who’s eighty-five or older is more than three times higher than it is with a teenage driver. 

## Chapter 3: Dependence

Old age is a continuous series of losses.

A 1912 report from the Illinois State Charities Commission described one county’s poorhouse as “unfit to decently house animals.”

A 1909 Virginia report described elderly people dying untended, receiving inadequate nutrition and care, and contracting tuberculosis from uncontrolled contagion. Funds were chronically inadequate for disabled care.

The Guru Vishram Vridh ashram, for instance, is a charity-run old age home in a slum on the south edge of New Delhi, where open sewage ran in the streets and emaciated dogs rummaged in piles of trash.

The most common complaint made is one I’ve heard often from nursing home residents: “It just isn’t home"

Harry Truman, an eighty-three-year-old man who, in March 1980, refused to budge from his home at the foot of Mount Saint Helens near Olympia, Washington, when the volcano began to steam and rumble.

Our old age homes didn’t develop out of a desire to give the frail elderly better lives than they’d had in those dismal places. We said, “This looks like a medical problem. Let’s put these people in the hospital. Maybe the doctors can figure something out.” The modern nursing home developed from there, more or less by accident.

The bureau of Health Insurance's ruling gave an opening to nursing homes, few of which met even minimum federal standards such as having a nurse on-site or fire protections in place. Thousands of them, asserting that they were in “substantial compliance,” were approved, and the number of nursing homes exploded—by 1970, some thirteen thousand of them had been built

Nursing home staff like, and approve of, residents who are “fighters” and show “dignity and self-esteem”—until these traits interfere with the staff’s priorities for them. Then they are “feisty.”

How do we make life worth living when we’re weak and frail and can’t fend for ourselves anymore?

# The Nordstrom Way to Customer Service Excellence

# Phase 1: Culture

## Chapter 1

Offer the customer the best possible service, selection, quality, and value. 

Establish a culture where outstanding employees would be rewarded for achieving sales goals.

## Chapter 2: Hire with Care

Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage.

Use good judgment in all situations.

* Creating a customer-first service mentality.
* Producing an honest and ethical way of doing business.
* Delivering compelling value.
* Treating people with respect.
* Rewarding hard work and results.
* Choosing to err on the customer’s behalf.

Hire the smile, train the skill.

A college degree has never been a requirement. Enthusiasm, a desire to work hard, and a capacity to generate your own traffic are much more important 

All tiers should work to support the sales staff, not the other way around.

Never hire managers from other companies

The people who are not hired are sent thank-you notes because their effort to apply is appreciated

When interviewing prospective employees, it is important to ask probing questions to draw out information about applicants’ attitudes and aptitude for customer service.

Your employees have a personal, financial, and professional stake in the success of our company. You’re encouraged to take ownership of your career.

## Chapter 3: Mentor, Support, Praise, Recognize, Reward

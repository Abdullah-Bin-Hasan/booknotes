# The Nordstrom Way to Customer Service Excellence

# Phase 1: Culture

## Chapter 1

Offer the customer the best possible service, selection, quality, and value. 

Establish a culture where outstanding employees would be rewarded for achieving sales goals.

## Chapter 2: Hire with Care

Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage.

Use good judgment in all situations.

* Creating a customer-first service mentality.
* Producing an honest and ethical way of doing business.
* Delivering compelling value.
* Treating people with respect.
* Rewarding hard work and results.
* Choosing to err on the customer’s behalf.

Hire the smile, train the skill.

A college degree has never been a requirement. Enthusiasm, a desire to work hard, and a capacity to generate your own traffic are much more important 

All tiers should work to support the sales staff, not the other way around.

Never hire managers from other companies

The people who are not hired are sent thank-you notes because their effort to apply is appreciated

When interviewing prospective employees, it is important to ask probing questions to draw out information about applicants’ attitudes and aptitude for customer service.

Your employees have a personal, financial, and professional stake in the success of our company. You’re encouraged to take ownership of your career.

## Chapter 3: Mentor, Support, Praise, Recognize, Reward

Top salespeople believe in making customers their best friends. Customers are there to spend money, so make them happy.

Salespeople should know everything about the item—the raw materials, the cut, the fit, the previous version, and so on, because it gives them credibility with the customer.

Twice a day, for 60 seconds, you should look a fellow employee in the eye and tell him or her how much the manager cares about that employee, and the reasons why.

Makes sure that you know the names and the faces of everybody who works in the store.

Don’t reinvent the wheel. Focus on winning one customer at a time. Be honest and sincere. Do what’s right. There’s nothing magical about this

When you recognize and praise your people, they will go out and do anything for you. Recognition is powerful, as long as it’s authentic and specific. 

## Chapter 4: Empower Entrepreneurs to Own the Customer Experience

You have to be confident enough in your system and your people to take your hands off and allow business to work.

Great new ideas emerge when employees feel empowered to offer suggestions on how to do their job better and more efficiently.

Snap judgments based on a customer’s appearance can cause you to lose out on a potentially lucrative sale.

The return policy is virtually an unconditional money-back guarantee.

Salespeople are judged on their performance, not their obedience to orders.

## Chapter 5: Compensate according to rules

When you have star salespeople, they ought to get paid like stars because they earn it

the only way people will be loyal to a company is if they are given appreciation, respect, good pay, and a piece of the action.

## Chapter 6: Communication and Teamwork

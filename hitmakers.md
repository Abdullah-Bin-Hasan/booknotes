# Part 1: Popularity and the Mind
## Chapter 1: The power of exposure

Famous paintings, hit songs, and blockbusters that seem to float effortlessly on the cultural consciousness have a hidden genesis
 
The core seven impressionist painters were the only seven impressionists in Gustave Caillebotte’s bequest, 
 
Subjects around the world prefer familiar shapes, landscapes, consumer goods, songs, and human voices.
  
When it comes to looks, average is truly beautiful. Several studies using computer simulations have shown that blending many faces of the same gender creates a countenance more attractive than its individuals.
  
Omnipresent airplay is critical to make a hit. “Every bit of consumer research we’ve ever done shows only one consistent thing: Radio is the number one driver of sales and the biggest predictor of a song’s success,”

Every social media account, every blogger, every website, and every promiscuously shared video is essentially a radio station.

Above a certain level, catchiness doesn’t make a song a monster hit. Exposure does.

 The GOP candidates with the most elite support, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, spent about $140 million on television ads through early 2016, but they both flamed out. The GOP candidate with the least elite support, Donald Trump, spent less than $20 million on advertising.

## Chapter 2: The maya rule

People gravitate to products that are bold, yet instantly comprehensible—“Most Advanced Yet Acceptable."

neither measure of typicality nor novelty alone had much to do with most people’s preference; only taken together did they consistently predict the designs that people said they liked.

 First, understand how people behave; second, build products that match their habits.
 
 “The consumer is influenced in his choice of styling by two opposing factors: (a) attraction to the new and (b) resistance to the unfamiliar,” he wrote. “When resistance to the unfamiliar reaches the threshold of a shock-zone and resistance to buying sets in, the design in question has reached its MAYA stage: Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.”
 
  The trick is learning to frame your new ideas as tweaks of old ideas, to mix a little fluency with a little disfluency—to make your audience see the familiarity behind the surprise.
  
 1. Audiences don’t know everything, but they know more than creators do
 2. To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising
 3. People sometimes don’t know what they want until they already love it.

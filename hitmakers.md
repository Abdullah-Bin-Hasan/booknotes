# Part 1: Popularity and the Mind
## Chapter 1: The power of exposure

Famous paintings, hit songs, and blockbusters that seem to float effortlessly on the cultural consciousness have a hidden genesis
 
The core seven impressionist painters were the only seven impressionists in Gustave Caillebotte’s bequest, 
 
Subjects around the world prefer familiar shapes, landscapes, consumer goods, songs, and human voices.
  
When it comes to looks, average is truly beautiful. Several studies using computer simulations have shown that blending many faces of the same gender creates a countenance more attractive than its individuals.
  
Omnipresent airplay is critical to make a hit. “Every bit of consumer research we’ve ever done shows only one consistent thing: Radio is the number one driver of sales and the biggest predictor of a song’s success,”

Every social media account, every blogger, every website, and every promiscuously shared video is essentially a radio station.

Above a certain level, catchiness doesn’t make a song a monster hit. Exposure does.

 The GOP candidates with the most elite support, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, spent about $140 million on television ads through early 2016, but they both flamed out. The GOP candidate with the least elite support, Donald Trump, spent less than $20 million on advertising.
 
Less thinking leads to more liking. 
  
## Chapter 2: The maya rule

People gravitate to products that are bold, yet instantly comprehensible—“Most Advanced Yet Acceptable."

Neither measure of typicality nor novelty alone had much to do with most people’s preference; only taken together did they consistently predict the designs that people said they liked.

First, understand how people behave; second, build products that match their habits.
 
“The consumer is influenced in his choice of styling by two opposing factors: (a) attraction to the new and (b) resistance to the unfamiliar,” he wrote. “When resistance to the unfamiliar reaches the threshold of a shock-zone and resistance to buying sets in, the design in question has reached its MAYA stage: Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.”
 
The trick is learning to frame your new ideas as tweaks of old ideas, to mix a little fluency with a little disfluency—to make your audience see the familiarity behind the surprise.
  
 1. Audiences don’t know everything, but they know more than creators do
 2. To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising
 3. People sometimes don’t know what they want until they already love it.
 
 
## Chapter 3: The music of sound

The construction of a pop song is something almost mathematical.

If you take a spoken phrase and repeat it at a common interval, the spoken words can evolve to sound like music.

A great musical hook is a great question with an answer that asks to repeat the question.

The top 1 percent of bands and solo artists now earn about 80 percent of all recorded music revenue.

The idea is to be repetitive up to the point where people might pull their hair out, and then change things subtly.

Always try to imagine the audience: Where are they coming from? What base of knowledge are they starting from? How do we both connect to where they are and lift them up a little bit?

The king of all modern speech-making tricks, antimetabole, is rhetorical inversion: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight; it’s the size of the fight in the dog.”

People don’t remember songs for the verses. They remember songs for the chorus. If you want to make something memorable, you have to repeat it.

The key to catchy writing is simple. Just write in pairs

## Chapter 4: The Myth Making Mind; The Force of Story

Was Star Wars the hit of the century because it was like nothing that had come before it? Or was it popular because, at its heart, it is the sum of a thousand stories?

What a story must do:

1. A hero must inspire
2. Hero must be relatable
3. Have prepackaged suspense

The key to success: You take twenty-five things that are in any successful genre, and you reverse one of them

Readers “significantly preferred” spoiled stories over unspoiled stories

## Chapter 5: The Myth Making Mind; The Dark Side of Hits

Vampirism accounted for every observable detail surrounding death. It explained why families got sick at the same time, why friends died after friends, and why the buried dead looked the way they looked. It’s not coincidence that, for many centuries, these myths stalked villages separated by tens of thousands of miles. 

Broccoli evolved to produce a foul-tasting compound called goitrin so that animals wouldn’t eat it into extinction.

The members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were 94 percent white and 77 percent male

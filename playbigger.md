# Part 1: The Category King Economy

## Chapter 1: Creation Wins

Category kings are all around us. They create entirely new categories of business, or entirely new ways of doing things. 

Uber was creating a category of business that never before existed, and the company put it into our minds that it uniquely understood the problem and could craft a solution.

The most exciting companies create. They give us new ways of living, thinking, or doing business, many times solving a problem we didn’t know we had—or a problem we didn’t pay attention to because we never thought there was another way.

Category kings take it upon themselves to design a great product, a great company, and a great category at the same time.

It’s almost always futile to try to unseat a category king that’s not screwing up

Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding

Good outcomes don’t happen by accident even in chaotic multidimensional games like poker, or business.

Being first to invent something can be fantastically important, but it doesn’t mean squat if you don’t define and develop the category. 
 
## Chapter 2: Category is the new strategy  

A company that best frames a problem is the company that often comes to define and take the category. Put another way: winning companies today market the problem, not just the solution.

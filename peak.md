# Peak Performance

## Notes by Christopher Durr

# Introduction

The bar for human performance is at an all-time high. New athletic records are being set weekly. College admissions requirements are at unprecedented levels. Cutthroat competition is common in nearly every corner of the global economy.

Data shows the use of antidepressants by Americans has risen by 400 percent in the past decade and anxiety is at an all-time high.

The epidemic of stimulant use in America is simply a symptom of modern life: on your game 24/7, tethered to your email, needing to perform better today than you did yesterday

Studies have found that over 57 percent of medical residents and up to 46 percent of bona fide physicians meet the criteria for burnout. Other research shows that over 30 percent of teachers suffer from burnout as well.

## The Secret to Sustainable Success

The brightest minds spend their time either pursuing an activity with ferocious intensity, or engaging in complete restoration and recovery. 

A common process across almost all great intellectual and creative performers, regardless of their field:

1.Immersion: total engagement in their work with deep, unremitting focus

2.Incubation: a period of rest and recovery when they are not at all thinking about their work

3.Insight: the occurrence of “aha” or “eureka” moments—the emergence of new ideas and growth in their thinking

**Performance Practices**

* Insert short breaks throughout your work over the course of a day.

* Strategically time your “off-days,” long weekends, and vacations to follow periods of heavy stress.

We have a single reservoir of brainpower for all acts of cognition and self-control, even those that are unrelated.

stress + rest = growth.

* Remember that “stress is stress”: fatigue on one task spills over into the next, even if the two are completely unrelated.

* Only take on a few challenges at once. Otherwise you’ll literally run out of energy.

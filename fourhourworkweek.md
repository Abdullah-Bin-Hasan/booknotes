#The Four Hour Workweek
##By Tim Ferriss
##Notes by Christopher Durr

How to reinvent yourself: **DEAL**

* **DEFINITION**: Replaces self defeating assumptions
* **ELIMINATION**: Increase per-hour results ten times by developing a low-information diet and cultivating selective ignorance
* **AUTOMATION**: Puts cashflow on autopilot using arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of nondecision
* **LIBERATION**: Breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location

#STEP 1: DEFINITION

Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two very different things.

There are always lateral options. 

Retirement planning is the worst-case insurance. Retirement is flawed for three reasons:

1. It is based on the idea that you dislike what you are doing. 

2. Most people will never be able to maintain a decent standard of living when retired. 

3. If you do have a decent standard of living, one week into retirement you'll be incredibly bored.

Doing less is not laziness. Few people choose to actually measure the results of their actions.

Conditions are never perfect, and "someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave.

Ask for forgiveness, not for permission. 

Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses.

Money is not the solution. Relative income is more important than absolute income. 

**Eustress**: Stress that is healthful and stimulates our growth. People who avoid criticisms fail. Remove distress and find eustress

__QUESTIONS__

1. How has being "realistic" or "responsible" kept you from the life you want?

2. How has doing what "should" resulted in subpar experiences or regret for not having done something else?

3. Look at what you're doing and ask yourself, "What would happen if I did the opposite of those around me? What will I sacrifice if I continue on this track for 5, 10, 20 years?"

"Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action."

**Pushing away fear**

__QUESTIONS__

1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. 
2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? 
3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? 
4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
5. What are you putting off out of fear?
6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action?
7. What are you waiting for? If the answer is only "good timing", then you're irrationally afraid to take the next step.

**Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic**

If the payoff is mediocre or average, so is your effort. 

Boredom is the enemy. Not failure. 

When making goals:

1. The goals shift from ambiguous wants to well-defined steps
2. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective
3. Focuses on activities that will fill vacuum when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires you to do interesting things and not just owning enviable things

**Comfort Challenge**

"Success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing to have"

Learn to eye gaze

#STEP 2: Elimination

1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.
2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important. 

20/80 principle: 20% of effort is providing 80% of the outcome

"Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant."

Parkinson's law: "A task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion"

1. Limit tasks to the most important to shorten work time (80/20).
2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law). 
3. If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different timeconsuming activities, what would you remove?
4. What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I’ve been productive?
5. Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?”
6. Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?
7. Do not multitask. 
8. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate focused action instead of deliberation and procrastination.

**Comfort Challenge**

Stop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions.
**Low information diet**

Most information is time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence

1. No newspapers, magazines, audiobooks, or nonmusic radio. Music is permitted at all times.
2. No news websites whatsoever (cnn.com, drudgereport.com, msn.com, 10 etc.).
3. No television at all, except for one hour of pleasure viewing each evening.
4. No reading books, except for this book and one hour of fiction reading prior to bed. 
5. No web surfing at the desk unless it is necessary to complete a work task for that day.
6. Necessary means necessary, not nice to have. 

Develop the habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?

Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will help you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time. 

Master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings. 

People are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove themselves. '

**Comfort Challenge**
Say “no” to all requests. Don’t be selective.

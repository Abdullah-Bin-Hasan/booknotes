#The Four Hour Workweek
##By Tim Ferriss
##Notes by Christopher Durr

How to reinvent yourself: **DEAL**

* **DEFINITION**: Replaces self defeating assumptions
* **ELIMINATION**: Increase per-hour results ten times by developing a low-information diet and cultivating selective ignorance
* **AUTOMATION**: Puts cashflow on autopilot using arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of nondecision
* **LIBERATION**: Breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location

#STEP 1: DEFINITION

Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two very different things.

There are always lateral options. 

Retirement planning is the worst-case insurance. Retirement is flawed for three reasons:

1. It is based on the idea that you dislike what you are doing. 

2. Most people will never be able to maintain a decent standard of living when retired. 

3. If you do have a decent standard of living, one week into retirement you'll be incredibly bored.

Doing less is not laziness. Few people choose to actually measure the results of their actions.

Conditions are never perfect, and "someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave.

Ask for forgiveness, not for permission. 

Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses.

Money is not the solution. Relative income is more important than absolute income. 

**Eustress**: Stress that is healthful and stimulates our growth. People who avoid criticisms fail. Remove distress and find eustress

__QUESTIONS__

1. How has being "realistic" or "responsible" kept you from the life you want?

2. How has doing what "should" resulted in subpar experiences or regret for not having done something else?

3. Look at what you're doing and ask yourself, "What would happen if I did the opposite of those around me? What will I sacrifice if I continue on this track for 5, 10, 20 years?"

"Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action."

**Pushing away fear**

__QUESTIONS__

1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. 
2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? 
3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? 
4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
5. What are you putting off out of fear?
6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action?
7. What are you waiting for? If the answer is only "good timing", then you're irrationally afraid to take the next step.

**Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic**

If the payoff is mediocre or average, so is your effort. 

Boredom is the enemy. Not failure.

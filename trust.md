# Who can you trust? Rachel Botsman

## Chapter 1: Trust leaps
Trust is a confident relationship with the unknown.

In 2016, the Alibaba Group overtook Walmart as the world’s largest retailer.

Trust is the conduit through which new ideas travel. Trust drives change.
Throughout history, humans have demonstrated a remarkable propensity to change the way we do things–bank, trade, travel, consume, learn and date. 

When one party has less information than the other, economists call it information asymmetry

Putnam argues that close-knit suburbs have given way to ‘exurbs’ and ‘edge cities’–vast anonymous places where people spend more time commuting to work, at the office and watching TV alone, and less time socializing with friends, neighbours, community groups and even family.

Out of such shared values comes trust, and trust has a large and measurable economic value

## Chapter 2: Losing Faith

African-American men today have the worst health outcomes of all major racial, ethnic and demographic groups in the United States. The life expectancy of black men at age forty-five is three years less than for their white counterparts

When someone doesn’t trust their doctor, typically they stop going for check-ups or for care when they need it. The researchers deduced that, as a general principle, this has led to a decrease in life expectancy of 1.4 years among black men over forty-five, many black men trust their barbers far more than they trust their doctors.

The Panama Papers revealed that between 1977 and 2015, the firm Mossack Fonseca had created more than 200,000 offshore shell companies in tax havens around the world, for world leaders and their families including President Putin and Kojo Annan, son of the former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, celebrities such as footballer Lionel Messi

In all, 29 of the billionaires featured in Forbes Magazine’s list of the world’s 500 richest people, 12 serving or former world leaders and 140 politicians were named in the Panama Papers. In terms of age groups, millennials are the most doubting. According to a 2015 survey conducted by the Harvard University Institute of Politics, 86 per cent of them distrust financial institutions. Three in four millennials ‘sometimes or never’ trust the federal government to do the right thing and a staggering 88 per cent ‘sometimes or never’ trust the media

Labaton Sucharow, a respected law firm based in the United States, conducted an independent survey to find out how financial insiders view other professionals within their industry. More than half of respondents believed that their competitors engaged in illegal or unethical behaviour. Nearly a quarter admitted they would engage in insider trading if they could get away with it and just under a third believed that financial services professionals might need to engage in illegal or unethical behaviour to be successful

Sociologists describe the innate tendency to associate and connect with people similar to us as homophily. 

 A friend or, say, a Facebook friend, is now viewed as twice as credible as a government leader
 
 It is estimated there are more than 3 million blog posts written in the world per day.
 
## Chapter 3: Strangely familiar

The trust stack goes like this: first, we have to trust the idea; then the company; and, finally, we have to trust the other person (or in some instances a machine or robot).

Trust in new inventions doesn’t happen by accident. There are some universal psychological and emotional hurdles to overcome first. The conditions that enable that to happen are summed up in three key notions: the California Roll principle, the WIIFM factor (‘what’s in it for me’) and trust influencers. The California Roll principle is based on the underlying rule of combining something new with something familiar to make it ‘strangely familiar’.

Apple does it through a design feature Steve Jobs called ‘skeuomorphism’. It’s a catch-all term for when design cues are taken from common objects or elements in the physical world.

Investors will run through ‘what if’ scenarios when assessing a deal. Specifically, ‘What’s the worst that can happen when using this product or service?’ In the case of Airbnb, a lot can happen and has since happened. Airbnb’s success rests on having been able to get people to make that staggering leap of trust and overcome our natural ‘stranger danger’ bias.

Even if people don’t believe that vaccines cause harmful side-effects such as autism, the power of anti-vaccination stories is they evoke fearful emotions that undermine our trust, no matter what we might rationally think.

That doesn’t mean we all need to understand precisely how a technology functions, whether it was a combustion engine back then or a blockchain now. However, we do need to grasp what it can do and what it can give us. Until that chasm is crossed, we won’t abandon what we already have.

The typical American commuter spends on average more than fifty-two minutes per day stuck in traffic. That adds up to more than 4 billion hours of wasted time in the United States alone, time we could use in better ways. ‘People want to know what they will be able to do if they are freed from driving the car,’

Humans are not ‘risk mutual’ people. In other words, they don’t place the same weight on things going well as things going badly. 

Trust influencers are groups of people who can disproportionately influence a significant change in the way we do something; they set new social norms.

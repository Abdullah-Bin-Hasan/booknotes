## Chapter 1: Biases and Blunders
How can people be simultaneously so smart and so dumb?

There are two kinds of thinking, one that is intuitive and automatic, and another that is reflec
tive and rational. We will call the first the Automatic System and the second the Reflective System

The activities of the Automatic System are associated with the oldest parts of the brain, the
parts we share with lizards

It is possible to predict the outcome of congressional elections with frightening ac-
curacy simply by asking people to look quickly at pictures of the candidates and say
which one looks more competent. These judgments, by students who did not know
the candidates, forecast the winner of the election two-thirds of the time

Although rules of thumb can be very helpful, their use can also lead to
systematic biases

**Anchoring**

You start with some anchor, the number you know, and adjust in the direction you think is appropriate. 
The bias occurs because the adjustments are typically insufficient.

When charities ask you
for a donation, they typically offer you a range of options such as $100,
$250, $1,000, $5,000, or “other.” If the charity’s fund-raisers have an idea
of what they are doing, these values are not picked at random, because the
options influence the amount of money people decide to donate.

In many domains, the evidence shows that, within reason, the more you
ask for, the more you tend to get

**Availability**

People can easily think of relevant examples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they
cannot. A risk that is familiar, like that associated with terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, will be seen as more serious than a risk that is less familiar,
like that associated with sunbathing or hotter summers

Vivid and easily imagined causes of
death often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes  receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency

**Representativeness**

When asked to judge how likely it is that A belongs to category B, people answer by asking themselves how
similar A is to their image or stereotype of B

We often see patterns because we construct our informal tests
only after looking at the evidence.

Basketball players who have made their last few shots are no more likely to make their next shot (actually a bit
less likely)

**Optimism and Overconfidence**

Ninety percent of all drivers think they are above average behind the wheel

94 percent of professors at a large university were found to believe that they are better

Lotteries are successful partly because of unrealistic optimism.

**Gains and losses*

Roughly speaking, losing something makes you twice as miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy.

Loss aversion helps produce inertia, meaning a strong desire to stick
with your current holdings. If you are reluctant to give up what you have
because you do not want to incur losses, then you will turn down trades
you might have otherwise made.

**Status Quo Bias**

People have a more general tendency to stick with their current situation.

One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention. Many people
adopt what we will call the “yeah, whatever” heuristic.

**Framing**

In numerous experiments, people react very
differently to the information that “ninety of one hundred are alive” than
to the information that “ten of one hundred are dead”—even though the
content of the two statements is exactly the same.

Framing works because people tend to be somewhat mindless, passive
decision makers.

## Chapter 2: Resisting Temptation

**Dynamically inconsistent**: Initially people prefer A to B, but they later choose B over A.

Self-control issues arise because we underestimate the effect of arousal. This is
something the behavioral economist George Loewenstein (1996) calls the “hot-cold empathy gap.”

Self-control problems can be illuminated by thinking about an individual as containing two semiautonomous selves, a far-sighted “Planner” and
a myopic “Doer.”

**Mindless Choosing**

In many situations, people put themselves into an “automatic pilot” mode, in
which they are not actively paying attention to the task at hand

Eating turns out to be one of the most mindless activities we do. Many of
us simply eat whatever is put in front of us.

**Self Control Strategies**

Planners have a number of available strategies, such as Clocky, to control
recalcitrant Doers, but they can sometimes use some help from outsiders.

In some situations, people may even want the government to help them deal with their self-control problems. In extreme cases,
governments might ban some items

Three-quarters of Americans get refunds when they file their tax return, with the average refund being more than two thousand dollars. If these refunds were described as
interest-free loans to the government, they would probably not be so popular.

**Mental Accounting**

*Mental Accounting* is an internal control system 

Money is “fungible,” meaning that it doesn’t come with labels. At the household level, violations of fungibility are everywhere

Experimental evidence reveals that people are more willing
to gamble with money that they consider house money

When investments pay off, people are willing to take big chances with their “winnings.” People are far more likely to splurge impulsively
on a big luxury purchase when they receive an unexpected windfall than with savings that they have accumulated over time

## Chapter 3: Following the herd

Humans are not exactly lemmings, but they are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others

If you see a movie scene in which people are smiling, you are more likely to smile yourself

Social influences come in two basic categories:

1. Information: If many people do something or think something, their actions
and their thoughts convey information about what might be best for you
to do or think.
2. Peer Pressure: If you care about what
other people think about you (perhaps in the mistaken belief that they are
paying some attention to what you are doing—see below), then you
might go along with the crowd to avoid their wrath or curry their favor.

The academic effort of college students is influenced by their peers, so
much so that the random assignments of first-year students to dormi-
tories or roommates can have big consequences for their grades and
hence on their future prospects.

If everyone in the room accepts a certain proposition, or sees things in a certain way, you might conclude
that they are probably right.

Consistent and unwavering people, in the private or public sector, can move groups and practices in their
preferred direction.

*collective conservatism* is the tendency of groups to stick to established patterns even as new needs arise.
An important problem here is *pluralistic ignorance*, ignorance, on the part of all or most, about what other people think.

Conformity could produce a very persistent nudge, ultimately generating behavior (such as the events in Jonestown) that might seem unthinkable.

**Spotlight Effect**

People are paying less attention to you than you believe. If you have a stain on your shirt, don’t worry, they probably won’t
notice. But in part because people do think that everyone has their eyes
fixed on them, they conform to what they think people expect.

In many domains people are tempted to think, after the fact, that an
outcome was entirely predictable, and that the success of a musician, an actor, an author, or a politician was inevitable in light of his of her skills and
characteristics. However, small interventions and even coincidences, at a key stage, can produce large variations in the outcome

About 44 percent of college students engaged in binge drinking. Most students believe that alcohol abuse is far
more pervasive than it actumally is.

**Boomerag Effect**

If you want to nudge people into socially desirable behavior, do not, by any means, let
them know that their current actions are better than the social norm.

**Priming**

Subtle influences can increase the ease with which certain information comes to mind.

The *mere measurement effect* is when people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers

If you ask people, the day before the election, whether they intend to vote, you can increase the probability of their voting by as much as 25 percent!

*“channel factors"* is a term used for small influences that could either facilitate or inhibit certain behaviors.

We can do more to facilitate good behavior by removing some small obstacle than by trying to shove
people in a certain direction

## Chapter 4: When do we need a nudge?

*Libertarian Paternalism* offer nudges that are most likely
to help and least likely to inflict harm

What do you need to know to design the best possible choice environment?

* Benefits Now, Cost Later: If there are unseen side effects, good candidate for a nudge
* Degree of difficulty: If it's hard, it's a good candidate for a nudge
* Frequency: If it's rare, it's a good candidate for a nudge
* Feedback: If you get little feedback, it's  good candidate for a nudge
* Knowing what you like: If you don't know if you'll like it, it's  good candidate for a nudge

Competition ensures that price serves as a good signal of quality

For irrational consumers to be protected there has to be competition.
Sometimes that competition does not exist.

Don't buy extended warranties

## Chapter 5: Choice Architecture

*Stimulus Response Compatibility* is the idea is that you want the signal you receive (the stimulus) to be consistent
with the desired action. When there are inconsistencies, performance suffers and people blunder.

Many organizations in both the public and the private sector have discovered the immense power of default options.

Humans will often consider required choice to be a nuisance or worse, and would much prefer to have a good default.

A *Post Completion Error* is when you have finished your main task, you tend to forget things relating to previous steps.

For birth control pills, the pills for days twenty-two through twenty-eight are placebos
whose only role is to facilitate compliance for Human users.

Warning systems have to avoid the problem of offering so many warnings that they are ignored.

Most patients decide which course of action to take in the very meeting at which their doctor breaks
the bad news about the diagnosis. The treatment option they choose depends strongly on the type of doctor they see

When we face a small number of well-understood alternatives, we tend to examine all the attributes of all the alternatives and then make trade-offs when necessary. But when the choice set gets large, we must use alternative strategies, and these
can get us into trouble.

*Elimination by aspects* is when someone first decides what aspect is most important, establishes a cutoff level, then eliminates all the alternatives that do not come up to this standard. However, alternatives that do not meet the minimum cutoff scores may be eliminated even if they are fabulous on all other dimensions.

**Incentives**

One way to start to think about incentives is to ask four questions about a particular choice architecture:

* Who uses?
* Who chooses?
* Who pays?
* Who profits?

Do the choosers actually notice the incentives they face? In free markets, the answer is usually yes, but in important cases the answer is no

The six principles of good choice architecture:
1. iNcentives
2. Understand mappings
3. Defaults
4. Give feedback
5. Expect error
6. Structure complex choices

# Part 2: Money

## Chapter 6: Save More Tommorow

In 2005 the personal savings rate for Americans was negative for
the first time since 1932 and 1933

Two central suggestions:
1. Automatic enrollment in savings plans; 
2. Save More Tomorrow Program 

Defined-benefit plans have one large virtue: they are forgiving to even the most mindless of Humans.
With Social Security, the only decision a worker has to make is when to start receiving benefits.

Defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans in the United States,
have many desirable features for modern workers. The plans are completely portable, so a worker is free to move from one job to another. Employees have to get around to joining, to figuring out how much to
save, to managing their portfolio over a period of years, and then to deciding what to do with the proceeds when they finally retire. People can find the whole process frightening

68 percent of 401(k) participants said that their savings rate is “too low,” 31 percent said that their savings rate is “about right,” and only 1 percent said their savings rate is “too high. Roughly 30 percent of employees eligible to join a 401(k) plan fail to enroll. Automatic enrollment has proven to be an extremely effective way to increase enrollment in U.S. defined-contribution plans. With automatic enrollment, participants join sooner, and more participants join eventually

58 percent spent less than one hour determining both their contribution rate and investment decisions

## Chapter 7: Naive Investing

The difference in the returns between Treasury bills and equities is called the “equity premium.”

Attitudes toward risk depend on the frequency with which investors monitor their portfolios

In general, diversification is a great idea, but
there is a big difference between sensible diversification and the naïve kind.

Five million Americans have more than 60 percent of their retirement savings in company stock. However, this way workers risk losing both their jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings all at once

There is no correlation between the allocation to company stock and subsequent stock performance.

A dollar in company stock is worth less than half the value of a dollar in a mutual fund

**If you have more than 10 percent of your retirement money invested in the company you work for, diversify as quickly as possible**

**Nudges**

*Defaults*: Give good defaults for Automatic Enrollment plans

*Mapping and Feedback*: Show investors what house they will get with each plan, for example. Make it tangible

## Chapter 8: Credit Markets

**Mortgages**

Even mba students at a top school had difficulty picking out the best loans, and this was in a task that was much simpler
than the one they would encounter in the real world.

African-American borrowers pay an additional $425 for their loans.
Latino borrowers pay an additional $400.

Loans made by mortgage brokers are more expensive than those
made by direct lenders by about $600

Microfinance loans in developing countries that led to Nobel Peace Prize for Muhammad Yunus in 2006
often come with interest rates of 200 percent or more

When interest rates vary and there are myriad fees to pay, just looking at the apr is far from enough

People who get the best deals are those who pay no fee up front.

How to fix it: Lenders would also have to provide a machine-readable detailed recap
report, one that incorporates all the fees and interest rate provisions, in-
cluding teaser rates, what the variable-rate changes are linked to, caps on
the changes per year, and so forth.

**Student Loans**

About two-thirds of four-year college students are in debt when they graduate.

Some colleges’ financial aid offices have tag-teamed with lenders who had provided gifts, stock options, and
“donations” to the college in order to become “preferred lenders". A
college’s financial aid staff tells students that they may choose only lenders
on a “preferred” list, even if these lenders don’t necessarily provide loans in
the best interest of the student. At one university, a lender was allowed to
provide staff for a call center under a college’s name; when students called
in to ask about loans, those “unbiased” employees pushed their own com-
pany’s loans.

**Credit Cards**

There were more than 1.4 billion credit cards in 2004 for 164 million cardholders—an average of 8.5
cards per cardholder. American households may have an average credit card debt of $12,000.

Credit card companies should be required to send an annual statement, both hard copy and electronic, that
lists and totals all the fees that have been incurred over the course of the year.

Credit card limits, which are in place to limit spending, may serve as high anchors that actually encourage spending.

## Chapter 9: Privatizing Social Security, smorgasboard style

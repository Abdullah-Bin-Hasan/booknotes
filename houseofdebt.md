## Chapter 1: A Scandal in Bohemia

By the end of 2008, the unemployment rate in Elkhart, Indiana, had jumped from 4.9 to 16.2 percent. 
Almost twenty thousand jobs were lost. The effects of unemployment were felt in schools and charities throughout the region. 
Soup kitchens in Elkhart saw twice as many people showing up for free meals, and the Salvation Army saw a jump in demand for food and toys during the Christmas season.
If it weren’t for the Great Recession, the income of the United States in 2012 would have been higher by $2 trillion, around $17,000 per household.

It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.

Between 2000 and 2007, the household debt-to-income ratio skyrocketed from 1.4 to 2.1.

Both recessions started off with a mysteriously large drop in household spending. Purchases of durable goods like autos, furniture, and appliances plummeted early in the Great Recession—before the worst of the financial crisis in September 2008.

Growth in household debt is one of the best predictors of the decline in household spending during the recession. Banking crises and large run-ups in household debt are closely related

The expansion in debt is five times as large before a banking-crisis recession

*Economic disasters are almost always preceded by a large increase in household debt*

The financial system actually works against us, not for us.

# Part 1: Busted

## Chapter 2: Debt and Destruction

For many Americans, home equity is their only source of wealth. The mortgage lender has the senior claim on the home and is therefore protected if house prices decline. The home owner has the junior claim and experiences huge losses if house prices decline.

House prices may fall so far that even the senior claims take losses, but they are much less severe than the devastation wrought on the borrowers.

During the Great Recession, house prices fell $5.5 trillion

Home owners in the bottom 20 percent of the net-worth distribution—the poorest home owners—were highly levered. 
 
The poorest home owners relied almost exclusively on home equity in their net worth. About $4 out of every $5 of net worth was in home equity 
 
The combination of high leverage, high exposure to housing, and little financial wealth would prove disastrous

Because low net-worth home owners had a leverage ratio of 80 percent, a 30 percent decline in house prices completely wiped out their entire net worth

The rich made out well because they held financial assets that performed much better during the recession than housing. 

A financial system that relies excessively on debt amplifies wealth inequality

A negative externality occurs whenever there are negative effects on other people from a private transaction between two parties

## Chapter 3: Cutting Back

The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the beginning of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007, three quarters before the failure of Lehman Brothers.

Residential investment was a serious drag on GDP growth even before the banking crisis. In the third quarter of 2008, the collapse in GDP was driven by the collapse in consumption. Non-residential investment contributed negatively to GDP growth, but its effect was less than half the effect of consumption.
The decline in business investment was a reaction to the massive decline in household spending

The MPC out of housing wealth tells us how many dollars less an individual spends in response to a wealth shock. 

The higher the leverage in the home, the more aggressively the household cuts back on spending when home values decline.

Rich households with little debt tend to have a very low MPC out of wealth. As a result, we shouldn’t be surprised that the bursting of the tech bubble had almost no impact on spending.

## Chapter 4: Levered Loss, the theory

A collapse in asset prices when an economy has elevated debt levels leads to economic disaster with massive job losses.

The supply-side view emphasizes the productive capacity, or supply, of resources.

Severe recessions are triggered even when no obvious destruction of productive capacity occurs.

The borrower has the junior claim on the home and therefore experiences the first losses associated with any decline in house prices.

The rich are protected against house-price declines not only because they are rich but also because they have a senior claim on housing.

The first way that the economy tries to prevent economic catastrophe when indebted households cut back is through a sharp reduction in interest rates

Very serious adjustments in the economy are required when levered households cut spending. Wages need to fall, and workers need to switch into new industries.

## Chapter 5: Explaining Unemployment

There was a very strong relation between job losses at auto dealers in a county and the size of the local net-worth shock. In counties with the largest shock to net worth, 14 percent of jobs at dealerships were lost.

4 million jobs were lost between March 2007 and March 2009 because of levered losses, which represents 65 percent of all jobs

Delayed foreclosures and government assistance reduced the incentive of workers to find jobs during the Great Recession.

A worker laid off in a recession loses income equal to three times his or her annual pre-layoff earnings over the rest of their lifetime

# Part II: Boil and Bubble

## Chapter 6: The Credit Expansion

*Marginal Borrower*: Borrower that is shopping for a low interest rate.

Throughout American cities, credit was pumped into low credit-score zip codes that were experiencing declining income growth.

At the peak of the housing boom in 2006, house prices in low credit-score zip codes had risen by 80 percent since 2002. In comparison, house prices in high credit-score zip codes had risen by only 40 percent.

House prices in high credit-score zip codes in inelastic cities increased by 50 percent between 2002 and 2006. However, house prices in low credit-score zip codes increased by twice as much, rising 100 percent over the same period. 

From 2002 to 2007, home owners in inelastic counties increased their debt by 55 percent compared to only 25 percent for home owners in elastic counties
 
## Chater 7: Conduit to Disaster

From 1993 to 1996, the volume of real estate loans tripled

in 1970 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development promoted securitization through government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)

The two most important mistakes made were related: investors underestimated the probability of mortgage default and the correlation of those defaults

This ability of structured finance to repackage risks and to create “safe” assets from otherwise risky collateral led to a dramatic expansion in the issuance of structured securities, most of which were viewed by investors to be virtually risk-free and certified as such by the rating agencies.  securitization directly encouraged irresponsible lending

One in ten mortgage loans in private-label securitization pools were misclassified as owner-occupied despite being investor-owned. 

A triple-A MBS originated in 2007 worth $100 in face value was trading at only $50 as of 2012

## Chapter 8: Debt and Bubbles

The main driver of asset-price bubbles was almost always an expansion in credit supply

What should be the price of an asset such as a stock or a house? Standard asset pricing theory suggests that it should equal the sum of expected payoffs from the asset

## Chapter 1: A Scandal in Bohemia

By the end of 2008, the unemployment rate in Elkhart, Indiana, had jumped from 4.9 to 16.2 percent. 
Almost twenty thousand jobs were lost. The effects of unemployment were felt in schools and charities throughout the region. 
Soup kitchens in Elkhart saw twice as many people showing up for free meals, and the Salvation Army saw a jump in demand for food and toys during the Christmas season.
If it weren’t for the Great Recession, the income of the United States in 2012 would have been higher by $2 trillion, around $17,000 per household.

It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.

Between 2000 and 2007, the household debt-to-income ratio skyrocketed from 1.4 to 2.1.

Both recessions started off with a mysteriously large drop in household spending. Purchases of durable goods like autos, furniture, and appliances plummeted early in the Great Recession—before the worst of the financial crisis in September 2008.

Growth in household debt is one of the best predictors of the decline in household spending during the recession. Banking crises and large run-ups in household debt are closely related

The expansion in debt is five times as large before a banking-crisis recession

*Economic disasters are almost always preceded by a large increase in household debt*

The financial system actually works against us, not for us.

## Chapter 2: Debt and Destruction

For many Americans, home equity is their only source of wealth. The mortgage lender has the senior claim on the home and is therefore protected if house prices decline. The home owner has the junior claim and experiences huge losses if house prices decline.
House prices may fall so far that even the senior claims take losses, but they are much less severe than the devastation wrought on the borrowers.

During the Great Recession, house prices fell $5.5 trillion

Home owners in the bottom 20 percent of the net-worth distribution—the poorest home owners—were highly levered. 
 
The poorest home owners relied almost exclusively on home equity in their net worth. About $4 out of every $5 of net worth was in home equity 
 
The combination of high leverage, high exposure to housing, and little financial wealth would prove disastrous

Because low net-worth home owners had a leverage ratio of 80 percent, a 30 percent decline in house prices completely wiped out their entire net worth

The rich made out well because they held financial assets that performed much better during the recession than housing. 

A financial system that relies excessively on debt amplifies wealth inequality

A negative externality occurs whenever there are negative effects on other people from a private transaction between two parties

## Chapter 3: Cutting Back

The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the beginning of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007, three quarters before the failure of Lehman Brothers.

Residential investment was a serious drag on GDP growth even before the banking crisis. In the third quarter of 2008, the collapse in GDP was driven by the collapse in consumption. Non-residential investment contributed negatively to GDP growth, but its effect was less than half the effect of consumption.
The decline in business investment was a reaction to the massive decline in household spending

The MPC out of housing wealth tells us how many dollars less an individual spends in response to a wealth shock. 

The higher the leverage in the home, the more aggressively the household cuts back on spending when home values decline.

Rich households with little debt tend to have a very low MPC out of wealth. As a result, we shouldn’t be surprised that the bursting of the tech bubble had almost no impact on spending.

## Chapter 4: Levered Loss, the theory

A collapse in asset prices when an economy has elevated debt levels leads to economic disaster with massive job losses.

The supply-side view emphasizes the productive capacity, or supply, of resources.

Severe recessions are triggered even when no obvious destruction of productive capacity occurs.

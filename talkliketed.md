## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Chapter 1: Unleash the Master Within

Be **passionate**

Science shows passion is contagious, literally. Express an enthusiatic, passionate, and meaningful connection to your topic. 

You cannot inspire others until you inspire yourself. 

What makes your heart sing? Once you identify what your passion is, can you say it influences your daily activities?

Is my motivation for this speech selfish or altruistic? Is my speech aimed at a few or a great #?

Most people will fail to have a great career because they fail to follow their passion. 

Accept happiness as a choice. What is one challenge you've faced recently? List three reasons why this challenge is an opportunity for you. 

People can tell when a person is displaying genuine passion and when they're faking. 

Passionate business leaders are more creative, set higher goals, exhibit greater persistence and get better company performance. 

**Note**: There's a correlation between passion and the likelihood that investors will fund ideas. 

Positive leaders are seen as more effective. 

Success doesn't lead to happiness, happiness leads to success. 

Don't be afraid to express your authentic self. 

If you want to help, listen. Never arrive to a community with your own preconceived ideas. Capture the passion, energy, and imagination of people in the community. 

## Chapter 2: Master the art of storytelling

__Why it works__: Stories stimulate and engage the human brain. 

You need data, facts, and analysis to challenge people, but you also need narrative. 

Brands that tell stories --emotional and genuine-- connect with their customers and audiences deeper than their competitors. 

**Note:** Take a presentation and categorize it based off of ethos (credibility), logos (evidence & data), and pathos (emotions)

"We all want affirmation that our lives have meaning"

Three types of stories:

1. Personal Stories
2. Stories of other people
3. Stories of brand success/failure

Break the pattern. Choose stories that lead to unexpected results. 

Abstractions are difficult to understand. Stories turn abstract concepts into memorable ideas. 

90% of all first business fail. 90% of all second business succeed. 

Behind every product is a story

**Note:** Think about a story you can include in your next presentation

Avoid overused buzzwords/cliches/jargon. These words are meaningless. Also avoid overused metaphors. 

Give your audience a character they can root for. 

**Note:** Introduce heroes and villains. Make sure the hero --your product, brand, role-- saves the day. \\

## Chapter 3: Have a conversation

Practice relentlessly and internalize your content so you can deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend. 

*Authenticity doesn't happen naturally.*

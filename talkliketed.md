## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Chapter 1: Unleash the Master Within

Be **passionate**

Science shows passion is contagious, literally. Express an enthusiatic, passionate, and meaningful connection to your topic. 

You cannot inspire others until you inspire yourself. 

What makes your heart sing? Once you identify what your passion is, can you say it influences your daily activities?

Is my motivation for this speech selfish or altruistic? Is my speech aimed at a few or a great #?

Most people will fail to have a great career because they fail to follow their passion. 

Accept happiness as a choice. What is one challenge you've faced recently? List three reasons why this challenge is an opportunity for you. 

People can tell when a person is displaying genuine passion and when they're faking. 

Passionate business leaders are more creative, set higher goals, exhibit greater persistence and get better company performance. 

**Note**: There's a correlation between passion and the likelihood that investors will fund ideas. 

Positive leaders are seen as more effective. 

Success doesn't lead to happiness, happiness leads to success. 

Don't be afraid to express your authentic self. 

If you want to help, listen. Never arrive to a community with your own preconceived ideas. Capture the passion, energy, and imagination of people in the community. 

## Chapter 2: Master the art of storytelling

__Why it works__: Stories stimulate and engage the human brain. 

You need data, facts, and analysis to challenge people, but you also need narrative. 

Brands that tell stories --emotional and genuine-- connect with their customers and audiences deeper than their competitors. 

**Note:** Take a presentation and categorize it based off of ethos (credibility), logos (evidence & data), and pathos (emotions)

"We all want affirmation that our lives have meaning"

Three types of stories:

1. Personal Stories
2. Stories of other people
3. Stories of brand success/failure

Break the pattern. Choose stories that lead to unexpected results. 

Abstractions are difficult to understand. Stories turn abstract concepts into memorable ideas. 

90% of all first business fail. 90% of all second business succeed. 

Behind every product is a story

**Note:** Think about a story you can include in your next presentation

Avoid overused buzzwords/cliches/jargon. These words are meaningless. Also avoid overused metaphors. 

Give your audience a character they can root for. 

**Note:** Introduce heroes and villains. Make sure the hero --your product, brand, role-- saves the day. \\

## Chapter 3: Have a conversation

Practice relentlessly and internalize your content so you can deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend. 

*Authenticity doesn't happen naturally.*

Three steps to deliver a perfect speech:

1. Help with planning
2. Early feedback
3. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse

**Note:** Record yourself giving a speech and play it back to yourself. 

Four elements of verbal delivery:

* Rate: speech at which you speak
* Volume: Loudness or softness
* Pitch: High or low inflection
* Pauses: short pauses to punch key words

**Note:** Speak in a conversational tone. Match the pace with your natural conversation style

The problem with most technical or scientific discussions is that the presenters fail to make their content visual, interesting, and entertaining. Those who do all three stand out. 

Believe in what you say

**Gestures**

* Use gestures. Don't be afraid to use your hands
* Use gestures sparingly. 
* Avoid canned gestures. Don't think about what gestures to use. Your story will guide them. 
* Keep gestures above the waist

Having an eager nonverbal communication  will increase the attractiveness of your request/offer. 

Three common issues with bodylanguage:

1. Fidgeting, tpaping, and jingling
2. Standing rigidly in place
3. Hands in pockets

Don't fake it until you make it. Fake it until you become it. 

## Chapter 4: Teach Me Something New

Reveal information that's new to your audience, package it differently, or offer a fresh and novel way to solve an old problem

Dopamine is a natural high that people get when learning something new and exciting. 

Just because you don't have earthshaking data doesn't mean you can't deliver it in a fresh way. 

You will become more interesting if you learn and share ideas from fields that are very different from your own. 

**Note:** Bombard the brain with new experiences. Experience new events, people, and places and incorporate them into your presentations

Great presentations give you ideas you've never considered

We all have unique stories to tell

If you can't explain your big idea in 140 characters or less, keep working on your message

**Note:** Create a twitter-friendly headline. 

## Chapter 5: Deliver Jaw-Dropping Moments

**Why it works:** Jaw-dropping moments create what neuroscientists call an emotionally charged event, a heightened state of emotion that makes it more likely your audience will remember your message and act on it. 

A memorable moment often gets shared, spreading the message much farther than its immediate audience. 

Find novel and memorable ways to communicate your message. Sometimes you need to surprise your audience to get them to care. 

You're more likely to remember events that arouse your emotions than events that elicit a neutral response. This is "flashbulb memories"

Use very concrete and meaningful examples to illustrate abstract poitns. Use images skillfully, whether beautiful, surprising, or disgusting. 

A howtopper can be as simple as speaking to the audience from your heart. No slides, props, video, just you. "What makes my heart sing is..."

How to create "Holy smokes moments"

* Props and Demos
* Unexpected and shocking statistics
* Pictures, Images, and Videos
* Memorable Headlines -- "soundbites"
* Personal Storires
* 

## Chapter 6: Lighten Up

**Why it works:** Humor lowers defenses, making your audience more receptive to your message. It also makes you seem more likable

Artfully weave anecdotes, stories, and humor into your narrrative. 

Don't repeat tired, crass, or dirty jokes. 

When we meet people with a good sense of humor, we are more likely to attribute other desirable traits to their personalities. 

Executives who are ranked outstanding used humor more than twice as often as average executives. 

*Don't try to be funny. Avoid telling jokes*

How to add humor to your speech or presentation

1. Anecdotes, observations, personal stories
2. Analogies and Metaphors
3. Quotes (Avoid overused/common quotes)
4. Video
5. Photos

Many powerpoint presentations are dreadful because they have little to no emotional impact. 

Be authentic in your humor.

## Chapter 4

Ask the buyer for more than you expect to get because it gives you some negotiating room

**Maximum plausible position**: The most that you can ask for and still have the buyer see some plausibility in your position.

1. It gives you some negotiating room. You can always come down but you can never
go up.
2. You might just get it.
3. It raises the perceived value of your product or service.
4. It avoids deadlocks caused by the conflicting egos of the negotiators.
5. It creates a climate where the other side can win.

The less you know about the other side, the more you should ask for. 
A stranger is more likely to surprise you, and you can build goodwill by making bigger concessions.

Counter by appealing to the buyer’s sense of fair play and using Higher Authority and
Good Guy/Bad Guy.

## Chapter 5: Bracketing

After your buyer states a position, you can bracket your position on the high side of your objective
—it’s best to do this with implied flexibility. 

You can only bracket if you get the buyer to state his or her position first.

**The Counter Gambit**: You can stop a buyer from bracketing you by getting him to commit
to a position first.

## Chapter 6: Never say yes to the first offer

Specific numbers build credibility

**The Counter Gambit**: The way to protect yourself from the Never Jumping at the First
Offer Gambit is to protect yourself with Higher Authority. Always be thinking to yourself,
“Whatever the buyer’s counterproposal may be, I can’t accept it. I have to take it to my
committee.”

## Chapter 7: Flinching

Flinching is critical because most people believe more what they see than what they hear.

**The Counter Gambit**: If someone pulls a Flinch on you first, the best thing to do is to
smile and recognize the Gambit

## Chapter 8: Playing reluctant seller

Look like you are reluctant to sell to the buyer so that the buyer is willing to pay more money to get you to sell it. 

Works also to be a reluctant buyer. Ask a lot of questions then say you couldn't possibly buy it. At the last moment, ask "What's the lowest price you would take?"

**The Counter Gambit** When you meet a Reluctant Buyer, say, “I don’t think there’s any
flexibility in the price, but if you’ll tell me what it would take to get your business (getting
the other side to commit first), I’ll take it to my people (Higher Authority—a Middle
Negotiating Gambit) and I’ll see what I can do for you with them (Good
Guy/Bad Guy—an Ending Negotiating Gambit).

## Chapter 9: Concentrate on the Issues

Have the buyers come to you instead of the other way around. 

Anger is a negotiating tactic

If the buyer gets upset with you, focus on the issues, not personality.

The only thing that matters is, “Where are we now, compared to where we were an hour ago, or yesterday or last week?”

## Chapter 10: The Vise Gambit

When they give you an offer, say “You’ll have to do better than that." then shut up. 

Don’t fall into the trap of negotiating percentages, when you should be negotiating dollars.

If it’s used on you, respond with the **Counter Gambit**, “Exactly how much better than
that do I have to do?” This will pin the buyer down to a specific number.

# Section 3: Middle Sales Negotiating Gambits

## Chapter 11: Higher Authority

Don’t let the buyer know that you have the authority to make a decision.

If they are forcing you to make a decision before you’re ready to do so, offer to
decide but let them know that the answer will be no, unless they give you time to
check with your people.

Your higher authority should be a vague entity, not an individual.

**Counter Gambit**: Always make the first move higher authority as a counter gambit. 

“I don’t mean to put any pressure on you, but if we’re going to go ahead on this we need to get it going
right away. So let me ask you this: If this proposal meets all of your needs is there
any reason why you wouldn’t give me a decision today?”

If they’re using escalating authority on you, revert to your opening position at each
level and introduce your own levels of escalating authority.

When you can't remove higher authority, do the following:

1. Appeal to their ego. 
2. Get a commitment that they’ll take it to the committee with a positive recommendation. Objections are buying signals
Indifference is the problem, not objections.

3. The qualified subject to close 

## Chapter 12: Avoid Confrontational Negotiating

Instead of arguing up front, which creates confrontational negotiation, get in the habit of agreeing and then turning it around

Ex. The buyer says, “Your price is far too high.” If you argue with him, he has a personal
stake in proving you wrong and himself right. Instead, you say, “I understand exactly
how you feel about that. Many other buyers have felt exactly the same way as you do
when they first look at our program. However, when they take a closer look at what
we offer, they have always found that we offer the best value in the marketplace.”

**Counter Gambit**

When a buyer does this, acknowledge the objection and use the vise gambit. 

## Chapter 13: Declining value of services

The value of a service always appears to diminish rapidly after you have performed that service.

If you make a concession during a negotiation, get a reciprocal concession right away

Agree on the price before you start the work.

Agree on a formula to use if circumstances change and you need to increase the fee.

Get paid in advance if you can.

## Chapter 14: Never Offer to Split the Difference

You should never offer to split the difference yourself, but always encourage the other person to offer to split the difference.

Emphasize how long you've spent negotiating with each other

**Counter Gambit**

If a buyer tries to split the difference with you, use higher authority and good guy/bad guy routine. 

By getting them to offer to split the difference, you put them in a position of suggesting the compromise. Then you can reluctantly agree to their proposal, making them feel that they won.

## Chapter 15: The Hot Potato

Buyers give you problems and you have to make it your own problem. 

Test the validity of the problem by asking them if you found the perfect thing they're looking for, wouldn't they pay more?

If they say they don't have it in the budget, ask when their budget ends. 

Don’t buy into their procedural problems. A procedure is just something that
somebody once wrote down.

## Chapter 16: Trading Off

Any time the buyer asks you for a concession in the
negotiations, you should automatically ask for something in return

If they know that every time they ask you for something, you’re
going to ask for something in return, then it stops them constantly coming back for
more. 

"If we can do that for you, what can you do for me?"

**Counter Gambit**

* Ask him what he wants and give it to him if the request is reasonable
* Tell him that you’ve already given him the best deal in the world and blame higher authority

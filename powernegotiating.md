#Section 2: Beginning Sales Negotiating Tactics

##Chapter 4

Ask the buyer for more than you expect to get because it gives you some negotiating room

**Maximum plausible position**: The most that you can ask for and still have the buyer see some plausibility in your position.

1. It gives you some negotiating room. You can always come down but you can never
go up.
2. You might just get it.
3. It raises the perceived value of your product or service.
4. It avoids deadlocks caused by the conflicting egos of the negotiators.
5. It creates a climate where the other side can win.

The less you know about the other side, the more you should ask for. 
A stranger is more likely to surprise you, and you can build goodwill by making bigger concessions.

Counter by appealing to the buyer’s sense of fair play and using Higher Authority and
Good Guy/Bad Guy.

##Chapter 5: Bracketing

After your buyer states a position, you can bracket your position on the high side of your objective
—it’s best to do this with implied flexibility. 

You can only bracket if you get the buyer to state his or her position first.

**The Counter Gambit**: You can stop a buyer from bracketing you by getting him to commit
to a position first.

##Chapter 6: Never say yes to the first offer

Specific numbers build credibility

**The Counter Gambit**: The way to protect yourself from the Never Jumping at the First
Offer Gambit is to protect yourself with Higher Authority. Always be thinking to yourself,
“Whatever the buyer’s counterproposal may be, I can’t accept it. I have to take it to my
committee.”

##Chapter 7: Flinching

Flinching is critical because most people believe more what they see than what they hear.

**The Counter Gambit**: If someone pulls a Flinch on you first, the best thing to do is to
smile and recognize the Gambit

##Chapter 8: Playing reluctant seller

Look like you are reluctant to sell to the buyer so that the buyer is willing to pay more money to get you to sell it. 

Works also to be a reluctant buyer. Ask a lot of questions then say you couldn't possibly buy it. At the last moment, ask "What's the lowest price you would take?"

**The Counter Gambit** When you meet a Reluctant Buyer, say, “I don’t think there’s any
flexibility in the price, but if you’ll tell me what it would take to get your business (getting
the other side to commit first), I’ll take it to my people (Higher Authority—a Middle
Negotiating Gambit) and I’ll see what I can do for you with them (Good
Guy/Bad Guy—an Ending Negotiating Gambit).

##Chapter 9: Concentrate on the Issues

Have the buyers come to you instead of the other way around. 

Anger is a negotiating tactic

If the buyer gets upset with you, focus on the issues, not personality.

The only thing that matters is, “Where are we now, compared to where we were an hour ago, or yesterday or last week?”

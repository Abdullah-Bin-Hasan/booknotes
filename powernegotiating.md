# Secrets of Power negotiating

# Section 1

## Chapter 1

* Trend 1: Buyers are becoming better negotiators
* Trend 2: Your buyers are better informed than ever
* Trend 3: Salesperson role reversal

## Chapter 2

Power Sales Negotiators leave buyers feeling that they have won.

Poor negotiators leave buyers feeling that they have lost.

## Chapter 3

People are predictable 

# Section 2: Beginning Sales Negotiating Tactics

## Chapter 4

Ask the buyer for more than you expect to get because it gives you some negotiating room

**Maximum plausible position**: The most that you can ask for and still have the buyer see some plausibility in your position.

1. It gives you some negotiating room. You can always come down but you can never
go up.
2. You might just get it.
3. It raises the perceived value of your product or service.
4. It avoids deadlocks caused by the conflicting egos of the negotiators.
5. It creates a climate where the other side can win.

The less you know about the other side, the more you should ask for. 
A stranger is more likely to surprise you, and you can build goodwill by making bigger concessions.

Counter by appealing to the buyer’s sense of fair play and using Higher Authority and
Good Guy/Bad Guy.

## Chapter 5: Bracketing

After your buyer states a position, you can bracket your position on the high side of your objective
—it’s best to do this with implied flexibility. 

You can only bracket if you get the buyer to state his or her position first.

**The Counter Gambit**: You can stop a buyer from bracketing you by getting him to commit
to a position first.

## Chapter 6: Never say yes to the first offer

Specific numbers build credibility

**The Counter Gambit**: The way to protect yourself from the Never Jumping at the First
Offer Gambit is to protect yourself with Higher Authority. Always be thinking to yourself,
“Whatever the buyer’s counterproposal may be, I can’t accept it. I have to take it to my
committee.”

## Chapter 7: Flinching

Flinching is critical because most people believe more what they see than what they hear.

**The Counter Gambit**: If someone pulls a Flinch on you first, the best thing to do is to
smile and recognize the Gambit

## Chapter 8: Playing reluctant seller

Look like you are reluctant to sell to the buyer so that the buyer is willing to pay more money to get you to sell it. 

Works also to be a reluctant buyer. Ask a lot of questions then say you couldn't possibly buy it. At the last moment, ask "What's the lowest price you would take?"

**The Counter Gambit** When you meet a Reluctant Buyer, say, “I don’t think there’s any
flexibility in the price, but if you’ll tell me what it would take to get your business (getting
the other side to commit first), I’ll take it to my people (Higher Authority—a Middle
Negotiating Gambit) and I’ll see what I can do for you with them (Good
Guy/Bad Guy—an Ending Negotiating Gambit).

## Chapter 9: Concentrate on the Issues

Have the buyers come to you instead of the other way around. 

Anger is a negotiating tactic

If the buyer gets upset with you, focus on the issues, not personality.

The only thing that matters is, “Where are we now, compared to where we were an hour ago, or yesterday or last week?”

## Chapter 10: The Vise Gambit

When they give you an offer, say “You’ll have to do better than that." then shut up. 

Don’t fall into the trap of negotiating percentages, when you should be negotiating dollars.

If it’s used on you, respond with the **Counter Gambit**, “Exactly how much better than
that do I have to do?” This will pin the buyer down to a specific number.

# Section 3: Middle Sales Negotiating Gambits

## Chapter 11: Higher Authority

Don’t let the buyer know that you have the authority to make a decision.

If they are forcing you to make a decision before you’re ready to do so, offer to
decide but let them know that the answer will be no, unless they give you time to
check with your people.

Your higher authority should be a vague entity, not an individual.

**Counter Gambit**: Always make the first move higher authority as a counter gambit. 

“I don’t mean to put any pressure on you, but if we’re going to go ahead on this we need to get it going
right away. So let me ask you this: If this proposal meets all of your needs is there
any reason why you wouldn’t give me a decision today?”

If they’re using escalating authority on you, revert to your opening position at each
level and introduce your own levels of escalating authority.

When you can't remove higher authority, do the following:

1. Appeal to their ego. 
2. Get a commitment that they’ll take it to the committee with a positive recommendation. Objections are buying signals
Indifference is the problem, not objections.

3. The qualified subject to close 

## Chapter 12: Avoid Confrontational Negotiating

Instead of arguing up front, which creates confrontational negotiation, get in the habit of agreeing and then turning it around

Ex. The buyer says, “Your price is far too high.” If you argue with him, he has a personal
stake in proving you wrong and himself right. Instead, you say, “I understand exactly
how you feel about that. Many other buyers have felt exactly the same way as you do
when they first look at our program. However, when they take a closer look at what
we offer, they have always found that we offer the best value in the marketplace.”

**Counter Gambit**

When a buyer does this, acknowledge the objection and use the vise gambit. 

## Chapter 13: Declining value of services

The value of a service always appears to diminish rapidly after you have performed that service.

If you make a concession during a negotiation, get a reciprocal concession right away

Agree on the price before you start the work.

Agree on a formula to use if circumstances change and you need to increase the fee.

Get paid in advance if you can.

## Chapter 14: Never Offer to Split the Difference

You should never offer to split the difference yourself, but always encourage the other person to offer to split the difference.

Emphasize how long you've spent negotiating with each other

**Counter Gambit**

If a buyer tries to split the difference with you, use higher authority and good guy/bad guy routine. 

By getting them to offer to split the difference, you put them in a position of suggesting the compromise. Then you can reluctantly agree to their proposal, making them feel that they won.

## Chapter 15: The Hot Potato

Buyers give you problems and you have to make it your own problem. 

Test the validity of the problem by asking them if you found the perfect thing they're looking for, wouldn't they pay more?

If they say they don't have it in the budget, ask when their budget ends. 

Don’t buy into their procedural problems. A procedure is just something that
somebody once wrote down.

## Chapter 16: Trading Off

Any time the buyer asks you for a concession in the
negotiations, you should automatically ask for something in return

If they know that every time they ask you for something, you’re
going to ask for something in return, then it stops them constantly coming back for
more. 

"If we can do that for you, what can you do for me?"

**Counter Gambit**

* Ask him what he wants and give it to him if the request is reasonable
* Tell him that you’ve already given him the best deal in the world and blame higher authority 


# Section 4: Ending Sales Negotiating Gambits

## Chapter 17: Good Guy/Bad Guy

Buyers use Good Guy/Bad Guy on you much more than you might believe. Look out for it whenever you’re negotiating with two or more people

It is a very effective way of putting pressure on the other person without creating
confrontation

**Counter Gambit**

1. Identify the gambit and call it out.
2. Respond by creating a bad guy of your own. 
3. Go over their heads to their supervisor
4. Let the bad guy keep talking. 

## Chapter 18: Nibbling

There’s a point in the negotiation when you’re very, very vulnerable, and that point is when you think the
negotiations are all over

After the decision to buy is made you can Nibble for a bigger
order, upgraded product or additional services

**Counter Gambit**

Try to prevent the possibility of a buyer Nibbling on you by:

Catch the other person when the tension is off and they feel good
because they think the negotiations are all over.

1. Showing them in writing what any additional concessions will cost them
2. Don’t give yourself the authority to make any concessions. Protect yourself with Higher Authority as I taught you in Chapter 4 and the Good Guy/Bad Guy Gambit

## Chapter 19: Patterns of Concessions

There are several errors often made when making concessions:

1. Equal-sized concessions
2. Making the final concession a big one
3. Giving it all away upfront. 
4. Giving small concessions upfront. 

The best way to make concessions is to offer a reasonable concession up front that might just
cinch the deal.

**Counter Gambit**

When you’re negotiating, you should always be keeping careful notes. So watch closely for the size of the concessions that the buyer is making to you and write them down.

## Chapter 20: Withdrawing an offer

Use it only when you feel that the buyer is simply grinding away to get the last penny off your price.

**Counter Gambit**

When someone uses this on you, don’t be afraid to insist that she resolve internal problems first

To avoid direct confrontation, make the Bad Guy a Vague Higher authority. Continue
to position yourself on the buyer’s side

## Chapter 21: Position for Easy Acceptance

If the buyer is proud of her ability to negotiate, her egotistical need to win may stop
you from reaching agreement

Position the buyer to feel good about giving in to you with a small concession made

**Counter Gambit**

If the buyer makes a token concession to you with the hope that it
will appease you, call his bluff

## Chapter 22: Writing the Contract

A huge advantage goes to the side writing the contract. 

Takes notes when negotiating and put a checkmark to points you will include in your final agreement. 

Before you sign a contract, read the current version all the way through. 

**Counter Gambit**

If the other party offers to write up the contract, say "Look, I have an attorney. I can have him write up the contract for no charge to the both of us"

# Section 5: Why Money Isn't as Important as you Think it Is

## Chapter 23: Buyers want to pay more, not less

Customers who may be asking you to cut your price are secretly wishing that they could pay more for your product

1. You must give them a reason for spending more.
2. You must convince them that they cannot get a better deal than the one you’re offering

## Chapter 24: Things that are more important than money

There's more to the price that you offer for your product. These all factor into the value of your product:

1. Being convinced they're getting the best deal
2. The terms you offer
3. The delivery schedule you offer
4. Experience you have in delivering the product
5. The guarantee that you offer and how well you stand behind what you do
6. Return privileges
7. Building a working partnership with your customer
8. Staff
9. Ability and willingness to tailor your product for your customers
10. Respect you give to them
11. Reliability

## Chapter 25: Finding Out How Much a Buyer Will Pay

Establish the most they can afford by offering a higher quality version

Determine their quality standards by offering a stripped down version

Don’t exacerbate the price problem by assuming that price is uppermost in the other
person’s mind.

# Section 6: Secrets of Power Sales Closing

## Chapter 26: The 4 Stages of Selling

There are four stages to a sale:

1. Prospecting for clients
2. Qualifying - Finding people who can afford your product
3. Desire-Building
4. Closing

## Chapter 27: 24 Power Closes

**Tugboat Close**

Just because a buyer told you no a minute ago, an hour ago, or yesterday, doesn't mean he'll say no again if you ask one more time

**Paddock Close**

Never think of no as a refusal. Just tell a story to take their mind off the decision they made. 

**"That Wouldn't Stop You" Close**

Whenever the other person raises an objection, say "That wouldn't stop you from buying this today would it?"

**You can afford it Close**

If you're dealing with affluent customers, say "You can afford it". 

**Leave them alone Close**

After you've pitched a product to somebody, leave them alone before they tell you if they accept or not. This gives them time to talk it over. 

**Vince Lombardi Close**  

When everyone says, "Give up. You've tried hard enough", give it one more effort. Sell the person something after they go through with the deal. 

**Silent Close**

Make your pitch and then shut up. The first person who talks loses. 

Always assume your customer will say yes. Don't say a word until you find out whether they will or they won't. 

**The Subject To Close**

Make the sale conditional on another event that will take place that is likely to occur. 

Ex. "Let's write up this paperwork subject to you getting financing for the house."

**Contingency Close**

Same as "subject to" Close except you don't know if the contingency will go through or not. 

**Ben Franklin Close**

Make the buyer do an exercise where they list the pros and cons, and if the pros outweigh the cons then they'll buy. Offer the buyer a long list of pros but when they have to list the cons they are on their own. 

**Dumb Mistake Close**

When the person is reluctant to buy, tell the person a dumb mistake another person made who was in the same situation because  they didn't buy. 

**Final Objection Close**

1. Appear defeated
2. Release the pressure
3. Get them to narrow it down to one objection
4. Overcome that objection

**Puppy dog Close**

Suggest they take the product home for a trial. This will encourage them to get the puppy. 

**Minor Point Close**

If you can get your customer to agree to minor points, when they get ready to make the big decision and they will feel less pressured. 

**Positive Assumption Close**

Assume the buyer is going to buy from you. 

**Return Serve Close**

When a buyer asks you a question, ask them a question back. 

Ex. Buyer - "Does this car come in black?"

Seller - "Would you prefer it in black?"

**Prisoner of War Close**

Relate a true and interesting fact to your buyers. Explain to your buyers that the ability to make good decisions under pressure is rare so they shouldn’t feel bad that they are having trouble making a decision.

**Alternate Choice Close**

When given two choices, the person will pick one or the other, not acknowledging that they don't have to pick either. 

Ex. "If you did buy this, would you use debit or credit?"

**Doorknob Close**

Whenever it seems like you won't go through with the sale, say "I don't think this will work out." and head towards the door.
Right as you're about to leave, say "I always try to learn whenever I fail to make a sale. Would you mind telling me what I did wrong? It would help in the future."

They'll tell you what you did wrong, and now you can do the Vince Lombardi Second Effort close. 

**Divide and Conquer Close**

Get the more assertive, analytical person out of the way and focus on selling to the less assertive person. 

**Let 'em Think Close**

Don't kill your sales by talking too much. Just because the buyer is silent doesn't mean they're disinterested, they could simply be thinking. 

**The Bank Note Close**

Use this when the buyer thinks a better opportunity will come along. 

Take a $20 bill out of your pocket, drop it on the floor, and put the toe of your shoe on it.
Then say, “Let me ask you this. If you were walking along the sidewalk and saw a $20 bill
lying there, would you pick it up? Of course, you would. It’s an opportunity that exists for
you, just as the investment I showed you is an opportunity. You wouldn’t pass up the
opportunity to pick up the $20 bill because there may be a $50 bill lying further down the
sidewalk, would you? But that’s exactly what you’re doing if you pass up an opportunity as
good as the one I showed you today!”

**The Recall Close**'

It's always smart to not tell your customer everything about the product and only suddenly recall it in case you're not able to close them. 

**Take Control Close**

Some people have a terrible time making a decision and won't make a move until someone tells them to. 

**Dawson Pledge**

If everything else fails:

Note the time on your watch and you mentally raise your left
hand, put your right hand over your heart and think, “I hereby pledge that I will not leave
these buyers until one more hour has gone by.” Whatever it takes, and even if you never
mention your product or service for one more hour.

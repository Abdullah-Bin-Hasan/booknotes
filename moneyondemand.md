## Chapter 1

Expect your webinar to convert one sale for every ten people who attend.

webinars allow you to sell high-ticket offers priced at $1,000 to even $10,000

1. Buy a quality headset with a microphone and mute button. Most popular currently is Logitech H390 USB Headset
2. Devise a catchy webinar title
3. Select topic of webinar
4. Understand your target audience.

When doing the webinar:

* Identify the webinar's intendend audience
* Describe who you are and why you're sharing the information
* Explain why the audience will benefit from the webinar
* Make sure content is structured in 3/5/7 easy steps
* Illustrate steps with stories/case studies
* Introduce your product/service

Remember that you’re not selling them a product; you’re offering a solution to their problem and helping them achieve an outcome faster through your product.

Don’t create the product until you sell it

The JV (joint venture) and partnership strategy is very fast and lucrative.

It involves marketing the webinar of a product owner for a 50-50 split of the sales generated. 

How to do it:

1. Identify and contact a JV partner
2. Schedule their webinar. Use a platform like gotowebinar.com
3. Promote the webinar to get as many people to watch it as possible

Adding large pictures to social media posts leads to more engagement and enables you to be more visible on people’s timelines.

How to build a marketing list:

* Solo ad
* Ad swaps
* Media Buying (buying advertising space on the internet)
* Social Media

## Chapter 3

Webinator, which allows you to automate your webinars, is a very simple software product. 

What also makes Webinator an effective tool is its ability to make the “pay” tab appear only after the offer has been presented and the price has been announced.

## Chapter 4

A small business owner works an average of twelve to sixteen hours a day.

For each business, a webinar facilitator performs the following tasks:

* Schedules webinars
* Sends emails to promote the webinars
* Finds partners to promote the webinars
* Records and automates the webinars
* Checks the sales

The money in an online business is usually made from the back-end sales of higher-end products and services, not the front-end ones offered.

To become a facilitator, you need to have a large targeted list. To get this list, you can do:

* Social media
* YouTube
* Banner ads
* Blogging
* Buying lists
* Cold calling
* Google ads
* Yahoo ads
* Conferences
* Networking
* Joint ventures
* Solo ads
* Ad swaps

Look on Amazon.com or Youtube.com. Experts usually have books listed on Amazon or have videos of their talks and presentations on YouTube. Look at podcasts, go to events.

Pick the best experts. A good expert or business owner to partner with should fit the following criteria:

1. They’re passionate about their topic and are already sharing it with people.
2. They walk their talk. If you find someone who is an expert in health and fitness, they need to be personally fit and healthy.
3. They love talking to customers and have good people skills. 
4. They have testimonials or success stories as a result of their expertise.
5. They must be willing to give you fifty per cent of their business.

## Chapter 6

Affiliate marketing is the process of promoting other people’s products on the Internet for a commission.

Clickbank.com offers affiliate networks online. 

An affiliate link is usually a long, quite ugly URL, which can easily be masked using a WordPress plugin such as ‘pretty link’.

* The headline (the webinar title)
* The introduction, explaining what led the presenter to deliver this presentation
* The content (which teaches the strategy)
* The close (which presents the product offer and call to action). Note that in all cases, the product hadn’t been created yet.

## Chapter 7

Audience members should have at least four or five ‘aha’ moments. They must leave the webinar feeling that they now have an advantage over someone who did not attend the webinar.

For collecting payments, use either paypal, infusionsoft.com, or 1shoppingcart.com

For generating traffic, you can use joint partnerships or udimi.com for emailng lists

Add urgency to the webinar by limiting seats available and making it timely to current events

**Income Loop**

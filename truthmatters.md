# Truth Matters
## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Chapter 1

The fairness doctrine is obsolete and cannot be revived

Conservatives were underserved for many years by traditional
media.

Progressives were slow to embrace new media such as talk
radio.

The complaint that the news media has a built-in bias is an old one—and there
is truth in it. In Jefferson’s day, newspapers were often owned by political parties
and were very overt in their bias

Many analysts believe that virtually all news publications now in print will disappear in a few years.

## Chapter 2

Primary sources are generally more reliable than secondary sources.

The quality of evidence varies, and documentary sources are usually best.

There are good reasons why officials leak information; not all are nefarious.

Reputable reporters will not take leaks at face value. They will know that they may be being manipulated by their source.

## Chapter 3

Links are like footnotes—essential documentation for facts.

The quality of a source needs evaluation before including a
link to it.

It is often better to link to a home page whose address
is unlikely to ever change and give readers a title that can be searched.

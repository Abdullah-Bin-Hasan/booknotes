# Truth Matters
## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Chapter 1

The fairness doctrine is obsolete and cannot be revived

Conservatives were underserved for many years by traditional
media.

Progressives were slow to embrace new media such as talk
radio.

The complaint that the news media has a built-in bias is an old one—and there
is truth in it. In Jefferson’s day, newspapers were often owned by political parties
and were very overt in their bias

Many analysts believe that virtually all news publications now in print will disappear in a few years.

## Chapter 2

Primary sources are generally more reliable than secondary sources.

The quality of evidence varies, and documentary sources are usually best.

There are good reasons why officials leak information; not all are nefarious.

Reputable reporters will not take leaks at face value. They will know that they may be being manipulated by their source.

## Chapter 3

Links are like footnotes—essential documentation for facts.

The quality of a source needs evaluation before including a
link to it.

It is often better to link to a home page whose address
is unlikely to ever change and give readers a title that can be searched.

## Chapter 4

Speaking off the record means that a reporter can quote what a source says, but they may not be identified by name or title. 

## Chapter 5

Reputable publications correct their errors promptly and prominently.

Always try to track down the original source for some story that you may consider citing or tweeting.

## Chapter 6

Not all academic sources are equal; universities are better than think tanks.

You cannot necessarily trust those anointed as “experts” on cable news or even in quality newspapers to really be experts on the subjects they are talking about. 

One way to find academic research is by using Google Scholar

CRS reports are recommended for those seeking an unbiased, authoritative, and reasonably accessible summary and analysis of some topic of current interest, such as health reform or tax reform.

## Chapter 7

Virtually all public libraries allow free online access to extremely valuable news and research databases.

Search engines of major newspapers are invaluable.

## Chapter 8

Price data from the past needs to be routinely adjusted for inflation.

Large numbers, such as the federal budget, are often best expressed as percentages of GDP.

A source of confusion arises from using an average or mean figure when the median may better convey what is happening. 

Be skeptical, and don’t be afraid to question a source or demand better context.

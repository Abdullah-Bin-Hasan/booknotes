# Black Swan by Nassim Taleb

# Part 1: How we seek validation

## Chapter 1

It is one thing to be cosmetically defiant of authority by wearing unconventional clothes—what social scientists and economists call"cheap signaling"—and another to prove willingness to translate belief
into action.

You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of
you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just
to show that you can walk the walk.

The human mind suffers from three ailments as it comes into contact
with history:

1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror
3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people

Much of what took place would have been deemed completely
crazy with respect to the past. Yet it did not seem that crazy after the
events. This retrospective plausibility causes a discounting of the rarity
and conceivability of the event.

Paul Veyne, aptly talked about religions spreading "like bestsellers"—a comparison that indicates unpredictability.

History and societies do not crawl. They make jumps.

the editing process can be severely distorting, particularly when the author is assigned what is called a "good editor."

Nobody knew anything, but elite thinkers thought that they knew more than the rest

There is arbitrariness in categories. try to explain
why those who accept abortion are supposed to be favorable to
high taxation but against a strong military. Why do those who prefer sexual freedom need to be against individual economic liberty?

Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity

## Chapter 2

The distinction between fiction and nonfiction is considered too archaic to
withstand the challenges of modern society.

## Chapter 3

To be genuinely empirical is to reflect reality as faithfully as possible; to be honorable implies not
fearing the appearance and consequences of being outlandish.

Get a profession that is "scalable," that is, one in which you are not paid by
the hour and thus subject to the limitations of the amount of your labor.

A scalable profession is good only if you
are successful; they are more competitive, produce monstrous inequalities
and are far more random, with huge disparities between efforts and
rewards—a few can take a large share of the pie, leaving others out en
tirely at no fault of their own.

death is often a good career move for an author.

much of what we ascribe to skills is an after-the-fact attribution. The movie makes the actor,
he claims—and a large dose of nonlinear luck makes the movie

*In Mediocristan, when your sample is large, no single instance
will significantly change the aggregate or the total.*

*In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can
disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total.*

Matters that seem to belong to Mediocristan (subjected to what we call
type 1 randomness): 

* height 
* weight
* calorie consumption
* IQ

Matters that seem to belong to Extremistan (subjected to what we call
type 2 randomness): 

* wealth 
* income 
* book 
* sales per author
* book citations
* name recognition as a "celebrity"

If you are subject to Extremistan-based speculation, however, you can gain or lose your
fortune in a single minute.

Some events can be rare and consequential, but somewhat predictable, particularly to those
who are prepared for them and have the tools to understand them (instead
of listening to statisticians, economists, and charlatans of the bell-curve
variety)

## Chapter 4

Something has worked in the past until it unexpectedly no longer does, and
what we have learned from the past turns out to be at best irrelevant or
false, at worst viciously misleading.

Mistaking a naive observation of the past as something de­
finitive or representative of the future is the one and only cause of our in­
ability to understand the Black Swan

You cannot manufacture more information than the past can deliver;

You can create Black Swans with science, by giving people confidence that the Black Swan
cannot happen—this is when science turns normal citizens into suckers.

In general, positive Black Swans
take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly

awareness
of a problem does not mean much—particularly when you have special in
terests and self-serving institutions in play

5 Themes that arise from blindness to black swan problems:

1. We focus on preselected segments of the seen and generalize from it to the unseen: the error of confirmation
2. We fool ourselves with stories that cater to our Platonic thirst for distinct patterns: the narrative fallacy
3. We behave as if the Black Swan does not exist: human nature is not programmed for Black Swans.
4. What we see is not necessarily all that is there. History hides Black Swans from us and gives us a mistaken idea about the odds of these events: this is the distortion of silent evidence.
5. We "tunnel": that is, we focus on a few well-defined sources of uncertainty, on too specific a list of Black Swans

## Chapter 5

our reactions, our mode of thinking, our intuitions, depend on
the context in which the matter is presented

Absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence

we have a natural ten
dency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the
world—these instances are always easy to find.

you know what is wrong with a lot more con­
fidence than you know what is right.

formulate a (bold) conjecture and you start
looking for the observation that would prove you wrong

## Chapter 6

We have a vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths

Our propensity to impose meaning and con
cepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concept.

We, members of the human variety of primates, have a hunger for rules
because we need to reduce the dimension of matters so they can get into
our heads

the same condition that makes
us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random than it
actually is

we will tend to
more easily remember those facts from our past that fit a narrative, while
we tend to neglect others that do not appear to play a causal role in that
narrative

You feel less guilty for not having avoided certain
events; you feel less responsible for it.

Empirically, sex,
social class, and profession seem to be better predictors of someone's be­
havior than nationality

The word senate comes
from senatus, "aged" in Latin; sheikh in Arabic means both a member of
the ruling elite and "elder."

the biggest killer remains the environment, respon
sible for close to 13 million deaths annually

The way to avoid the ills of the narrative fallacy is to favor experimen­
tation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge
over theories.

## Chapter 7

Our intuitions are not cut out for nonlinearities.

linear progression, a Platonic idea, is not the norm

when you look at the empiri
cal record, you not only see that venture capitalists do better than entre
preneurs, but publishers do better than writers, dealers do better than
artists, and science does better than scientists (about 5 0 percent of scien
tific and scholarly papers, costing months, sometimes years, of effort, are
never truly read)

Plenty of mildly good news is preferable to one single lump of
great news.

It is better to
lump all your pain into a brief period rather than have it spread out over
a longer one.

One of the attributes of a Black Swan is an asymmetry in
consequences—either positive or negative.

some business bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet
loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them
and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina.

Humans will believe anything you say
provided you do not exhibit the smallest shadow of diffidence; like ani
mals, they can detect the smallest crack in your confidence before you ex
press it

## Chapter 8

History is any succession of events seen with the effect of posteriority

Silent evidence is what events use to conceal their own randomness,
particularly the Black Swan type of randomness.

We may enjoy what we see, but there is no point reading too
much into success stories because we do not see the full picture.

The more lethal the risks, the less visible they will be, since the severely victimized are likely to be
eliminated from the evidence

researchers confirm that gamblers have lucky beginnings (the same applies to stock market speculators).

we can see what governments do, and therefore sing their praises—but we do not see the alternative. But there is an alternative; it is less obvious and remains unseen. governments are great at telling you what they did, but not what they did not do.

We humans are an extremely lucky species, and that we got the genes of the risk takers. The foolish risk takers, that is

Do not compute odds from the vantage point of the winning gambler but
from all those who started in the cohort.

Have the integrity to deliver your "because" very sparingly; try to limit it to situations
where the "because" is derived from experiments, not backward-looking history.

## Chapter 9

Find who the sucker is

Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end
up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting
the shekels, buying the diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?

Furthermore, just as we tend to underestimate the role of luck in life in general, we tend to overestimate it in games of chance.

Why we do not see Black Swans: we worry about those that happened, not those that may happen but did
not. It is why those who "study" and fare well in school have a tendency to be suckers for the ludic fallacy.

We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened. In other words, we are naturally shallow and
superficial—and we do not know it.

If you want a simple step to a higher form of life then shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the
empirical.

# Part 2: We just can't predict

## Chapter 10

The Sydney Opera House was supposed to open in early 1963 at a cost of AU$ 7 million, ended up costing 104 million

We are demonstrably arrogant about what we think we know. We certainly know a lot, but we have a built-in
tendency to think that we know a little bit more than we actually do. 

*Epistemic arrogance*: Our hubris concerning the limits of our knowledge

Janitors and cabdrivers are more humble when it comes to estimations than Harvard MBAs. 

We overestimate what we know, and underestimate uncertainty, by compressing the range of possible uncertain states (i.e., by reducing the space of the unknown)

People who make forecasts professionally are often more affected by such impediments than those who don't

The more information you give someone, the more hy potheses they will formulate along the way, and the worse off they will be.They see more random noise and mistake it for information.

Experts who tend to be not experts: stockbrokers, clinical psychol
ogists, psychiatrists, college admissions officers, court judges, councilors,
personnel selectors, intelligence analysts (the CIA's record, in spite of its
costs, is pitiful). Economists, financial forecasters, finance professors, political scientists, "risk experts," Bank for International Settlements staff,and personal financial advisers.

Professions that deal with the future and base their studies on the nonrepeatable past have an expert problem

The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know.

What matters is not how often you are right, but how large your cumulative errors are. 

There was no difference in results whether one had a PhD or an undergraduate degree.
Well-published professors had no advantage over journalists. Those who had a big reputation were worse predictors than those
who had none.

How people get blindspots towards predictions:

1. You tell yourself that you were playing a different game.
2. You invoke the outlier.
3. The "almost right" defense.

Statistically sophisticated or complex methods do not necessarily provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones.

Scholarship without erudition and natural curiosity can close your mind and lead to the fragmentation of
disciplines.

The longer you wait, the longer you will be expected to wait.

When estimating, variability matters

## Chapter 11

The most important advances are the least predictable ones, those "lying out of the path of the imagination."

Tools lead to unexpected discoveries, which themselves lead to
other unexpected discoveries. But rarely do our tools seem to work as in tended; it is only the engineer's gusto and love for the building of toys and machines that contribute to the augmentation of our knowledge.

We build toys. Some of those toys change the world.

The best way to get maximal exposure is to keep researching and collect opportunities

Predict the spread of a technology implies predicting a large element of fads and social contagion, which lie outside the objective utility of the technology itself

*Law of iterated expectations*: If I expect to expect something at some date
in the future, then I already expect that something at present.

*ignoramus et ignorabimus*—"we are ignorant and will remain so"

Prediction requires knowing about technologies that will be discovered in the future. But that very knowledge
would almost automatically allow us to start developing those technologies right away. Ergo, we do not know what we will know.

As you project into the future you may need an increasing amount of precision about the dynamics of the
process that you are modeling, since your error rate grows very rapidly.

A true forecast is done organically by a system, not by fiat.
One single institution, say, the central planner, cannot aggregate knowledge; many important pieces of information will be missing.

While the scholastic-minded will
memorize declensions, the a-Platonic nonnerd will acquire, say, Serbo-
Croatian by picking up potential girlfriends in bars on the outskirts of
Sarajevo, or talking to cabdrivers, then fitting (if needed) grammatical
rules to the knowledge he already possesses.

"Linear regression" or "R-square" can ultimately fool you beyond measure, to the point
where it is no longer funny. You can fit the linear part of the curve and claim a high R-square,
meaning that your model fits the data very well and has high predictive powers. All that off hot air:
you only fit the linear segment of the series.

In a way, projecting allows us to cheat evolution: it now takes place in our head, as a series of
projections and counterfactual scenarios.

## Chapter 12

No philosophy could be effective unless it took into account our deeply ingrained imperfections, the limitations of our rationality, the flaws that make us human.

When we think of tomorrow, we just project it as another yesterday.

We laugh at others and we don't realize that someone will be just
as justified in laughing at us on some not too remote day

We do not learn recursively from past experiences. We have
evidence of a mental block and distortions in the way we fail to learn from
our past errors in projecting the future of our affective states.

Our problem is not just that we do not know the future, we do not
know much of the past either.

A true random system is in fact random and does not have predictable
properties. A chaotic system has entirely predictable properties, but they
are hard to know.

Learn to read history, get all the knowledge you
can, do not frown on the anecdote, but do not draw any causal links, do
not try to reverse engineer too much

## Chapter 13

we do effectively think, but that we more readily narrate backward in
order to give ourselves the illusion of understanding, and give a cover to
our past actions

Maximize the serendipity around you.

If you know that you are vulnerable to prediction errors, and if you accept that most "risk measures"
are flawed, because of the Black Swan, then your strategy is to be as hy perconservative and hyperaggressive as you can be instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative.

Do not try to predict precise Black Swans—it tends to
make you more vulnerable to the ones you did not predict.

Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity.
They are rare, much rarer than you think. Remember that positive
Black Swans have a necessary first step: you need to be exposed to
them.

Let governments predict but do not set much store by what they say.

## Chapter 14

Academic success is partly (but significantly) a lottery.

Ideas spread because they have for carriers self-serving agents who are in
terested in them, and interested in distorting them in the replication process.

The more socialist a country's orientation, the easier it was for the large corporate monsters to stick around.

Nobody is threatened with complete extinction. Our current environment allows the little guy to bide his time in the antechamber of success—as long as there is life, there is hope.

We will see more periods of calm and stability, with most problems
concentrated into a small number of Black Swans.

Social rank alone can affect longevity. It was calculated that actors who win an Oscar tend to
live on average about five years longer than their peers who don't. People live longer in societies that have flatter social gradients.

## Chapter 15

Most abuse of prisoners is attributable to a very small
number of vicious guards. Filter those guards out and your rate of prisoner abuse drops dramatically

There is a glorification of mediocrity in the United States

Given the paucity of large deviations, their contribution to the total will be vanishingly small.

## Chapter 16

The fractal has numerical or statistical measures
that are preserved across scales—the ratio is the same, unlike
the Gaussian.

It takes a long time for some fractal processes to reveal their properties, and
you underestimate the severity of the shock

A gray swan concerns modelable extreme events, a black swan is
about unknown unknowns.

It is contagion that determines the fate of a theory in social science, not its validity.

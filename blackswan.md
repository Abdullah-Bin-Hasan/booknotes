# Part 1: How we seek validation

## Chapter 1

It is one thing to be cosmetically defiant of authority by wear­
ing unconventional clothes—what social scientists and economists call
"cheap signaling"—and another to prove willingness to translate belief
into action.

You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of
you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just
to show that you can walk the walk.

The human mind suffers from three ailments as it comes into contact
with history:

1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows
what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random)
than they realize
2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only
after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror
3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of
authoritative and learned people

Much of what took place would have been deemed completely
crazy with respect to the past. Yet it did not seem that crazy after the
events. This retrospective plausibility causes a discounting of the rarity
and conceivability of the event.

Paul Veyne, aptly talked about religions spreading "like bestsellers"—a comparison that indicates unpredictability.

History and societies do not crawl. They make jumps.

the editing process can be severely distorting, particularly when the author is assigned what is called a "good editor."

Nobody knew anything, but elite thinkers thought that they knew more than the rest

There is arbitrariness in categories. try to explain
why those who accept abortion are supposed to be favorable to
high taxation but against a strong military. Why do those who prefer sexual freedom need to be against individual economic liberty?

Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity

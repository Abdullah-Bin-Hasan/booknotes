# Black Swan by Nassim Taleb

# Part 1: How we seek validation

## Chapter 1

It is one thing to be cosmetically defiant of authority by wear­
ing unconventional clothes—what social scientists and economists call
"cheap signaling"—and another to prove willingness to translate belief
into action.

You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of
you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just
to show that you can walk the walk.

The human mind suffers from three ailments as it comes into contact
with history:

1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows
what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random)
than they realize
2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only
after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror
3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of
authoritative and learned people

Much of what took place would have been deemed completely
crazy with respect to the past. Yet it did not seem that crazy after the
events. This retrospective plausibility causes a discounting of the rarity
and conceivability of the event.

Paul Veyne, aptly talked about religions spreading "like bestsellers"—a comparison that indicates unpredictability.

History and societies do not crawl. They make jumps.

the editing process can be severely distorting, particularly when the author is assigned what is called a "good editor."

Nobody knew anything, but elite thinkers thought that they knew more than the rest

There is arbitrariness in categories. try to explain
why those who accept abortion are supposed to be favorable to
high taxation but against a strong military. Why do those who prefer sexual freedom need to be against individual economic liberty?

Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity

## Chapter 2

The distinction between fiction and nonfiction is considered too archaic to
withstand the challenges of modern society.

## Chapter 3

To be genuinely empirical is to reflect reality as faithfully as possible; to be honorable implies not
fearing the appearance and consequences of being outlandish.

Get a profession that is "scalable," that is, one in which you are not paid by
the hour and thus subject to the limitations of the amount of your labor.

A scalable profession is good only if you
are successful; they are more competitive, produce monstrous inequalities
and are far more random, with huge disparities between efforts and
rewards—a few can take a large share of the pie, leaving others out en
tirely at no fault of their own.

death is often a good career move for an author.

much of what we ascribe to skills is an after-the-fact attribution. The movie makes the actor,
he claims—and a large dose of nonlinear luck makes the movie

*In Mediocristan, when your sample is large, no single instance
will significantly change the aggregate or the total.*

*In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can
disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total.*

Matters that seem to belong to Mediocristan (subjected to what we call
type 1 randomness): 

* height 
* weight
* calorie consumption
* IQ

Matters that seem to belong to Extremistan (subjected to what we call
type 2 randomness): 

* wealth 
* income 
* book 
* sales per author
* book citations
* name recognition as a "celebrity"

If you are subject to Extremistan-based speculation, however, you can gain or lose your
fortune in a single minute.

Some events can be rare and consequential, but somewhat predictable, particularly to those
who are prepared for them and have the tools to understand them (instead
of listening to statisticians, economists, and charlatans of the bell-curve
variety)

## Chapter 4

Something has worked in the past until it unexpectedly no longer does, and
what we have learned from the past turns out to be at best irrelevant or
false, at worst viciously misleading.

Mistaking a naive observation of the past as something de­
finitive or representative of the future is the one and only cause of our in­
ability to understand the Black Swan

You cannot manufacture more information than the past can deliver;

You can create Black Swans with science, by giving people confidence that the Black Swan
cannot happen—this is when science turns normal citizens into suckers.

In general, positive Black Swans
take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly

awareness
of a problem does not mean much—particularly when you have special in
terests and self-serving institutions in play

5 Themes that arise from blindness to black swan problems:

1. We focus on preselected segments of the seen and generalize from it to the unseen: the error of confirmation
2. We fool ourselves with stories that cater to our Platonic thirst for distinct patterns: the narrative fallacy
3. We behave as if the Black Swan does not exist: human nature is not programmed for Black Swans.
4. What we see is not necessarily all that is there. History hides Black Swans from us and gives us a mistaken idea about the odds of these events: this is the distortion of silent evidence.
5. We "tunnel": that is, we focus on a few well-defined sources of uncertainty, on too specific a list of Black Swans

# Ask More: The Power of Questions to Open Doors, Uncover Solutions and Spark Change
## Notes by Christopher Durr

# Chapter 1: Why ask?


SMART QUESTIONS MAKE SMARTER PEOPLE. We learn, connect, observe, and invent through the questions we ask.

# Chapter 2: Diagnostic Questions

Our need to identify problems so we can act on them is an ingredient of daily existence

Types of diagnostic questions:

* *Connect Symptoms and Specifics*: Get past the generic to identify the symptoms and describe related observations in detail.
* *Ask for the bad*:  Don’t duck the issues or avert your eyes. Ask direct questions in search of direct answers. 
* *Study history*: Look back. Ask about similar experiences, events, and patterns.
* *Ask again*: The mere existence of a problem means there is something unknown or unanticipated. To be sure you’re on solid ground, ask several times and several sources. Confirm and corroborate.
* *Challenge the expert*: We rely on experts to diagnose our disease. But that doesn’t mean they’re right or that they’re off the hook in explaining what’s going on. Before you accept a diagnosis, ask what it is, what it means, and where it’s coming from.

Write out a list of questions and don’t let up until every one of them is addressed. If the specialist you’ve chosen can’t or won’t answer your questions, see that as a red flag, a clear sign that you need to get a second (or third) opinion

# Chapter 3: Strategic Questions

* What is the extent of the problem?
* What will it take to succeed?
* Are we up to the challenge?

Types of Strategic Questions

* *Get the big picture*.: Define the challenge or opportunity. Ask why it matters. Articulate the goal. Does it reflect your values? Who else cares? What are others prepared to do? 
* *Know what you’re up against.*: Recognize that you have a worthy opponent, whether it’s a person, place, or, in the Gates’s case, a disease. Give it credit. It’s the biggest obstacle that stands in your way.
* *Define your plan.*: Determine the tactics that will help you achieve your strategic goal. What are the next steps and the steps down the road? Who does what? And how will you measure success along the way?
* *Challenge yourself.*: Hold your plan or proposal up to the light and look for holes. Play out different scenarios. What haven’t you thought of? What can go wrong? 
* *Define success.* Can you explain what success looks like? How will you know it when you achieve it?

When taking controversial action, ask:

* Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed?
* Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?
* Do we have a clear and attainable objective?

When taking another possible job, ask yourself:

1. Do I have an obligation?
2. Do I really want to do it?
3. Do I have the passion to do it?
4. Do I have the organizational ability to do it?
5. Am I going to enjoy the work or be good at it?
6. What is my family’s view of this?

When considering a major decision:

* Does it feel right—is it important, consistent with my values?
* Do I have the passion to do this and stick with it?
* Can I define “success”?
* Do I have the tools to achieve it?
* Have I calculated costs and benefits, risks, rewards, and alternatives?
* What are the consequences for my emotional, intellectual, and spiritual well-being?
* Would the people closest to me think this is a good idea?
* If this ended up in my biography (or obituary), would I be proud to see it there?

## Chapter 4: Empathy Questions

Types of empathy questions:

* *Try new shoes*: Empathy involves taking the perspective of another person. What is he thinking? How is he feeling? If you switched places and stood in his shoes, what would you see?
* *Leave running room*: Start with big broad questions to get people talking. Invite them to engage on ground where they’re most comfortable and most familiar.
* *Listen beyond words*: The deeper you go, the more you need to listen for cues and tone and mood. Pauses and hesitation have meaning, too. So do body language, facial expressions, and eye contact.
* *Establish intimate distance*: Convey compassion and interest. But maintain enough distance and detachment so you don’t judge and can offer objective questions or advice.

You can ask questions about their childhood and find out, were they sick, were they well? Just all those things that create who you are.

## Chapter 5: Bridging Questions

Bridging questions are intended to encourage people to talk when they don’t want to. They coax information, glean detail, and assess intent and capability.

Your prospects of getting a closed person to open up is enhanced if you:

* *Know what you’re after*: Be clear about what you want to pursue and the nature of the problem. Have a focus and a destination in mind.
* *Avoid triggers*: Don’t start with accusations or questions that prompt defensiveness. Go instead for conversation. You want to open a channel of communication.
* *Don’t accuse, ask*: Start with the person’s grievance and inquire about it. What’s wrong? What’s unfair? 
* *Affirm and validate*: Walking someone across a bridge takes them farther than pushing them off a cliff. 

Bridge-building questions work best when people are at cognitive ease and feel they have a receptive audience.

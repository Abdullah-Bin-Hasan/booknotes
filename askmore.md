# Ask More: The Power of Questions to Open Doors, Uncover Solutions and Spark Change
## Notes by Christopher Durr

# Chapter 1: Why ask?


SMART QUESTIONS MAKE SMARTER PEOPLE. We learn, connect, observe, and invent through the questions we ask.

# Chapter 2: Diagnostic Questions

Our need to identify problems so we can act on them is an ingredient of daily existence

Types of diagnostic questions:

* *Connect Symptoms and Specifics*: Get past the generic to identify the symptoms and describe related observations in detail.
* *Ask for the bad*:  Don’t duck the issues or avert your eyes. Ask direct questions in search of direct answers. 
* *Study history*: Look back. Ask about similar experiences, events, and patterns.
* *Ask again*: The mere existence of a problem means there is something unknown or unanticipated. To be sure you’re on solid ground, ask several times and several sources. Confirm and corroborate.
* *Challenge the expert*: We rely on experts to diagnose our disease. But that doesn’t mean they’re right or that they’re off the hook in explaining what’s going on. Before you accept a diagnosis, ask what it is, what it means, and where it’s coming from.

Write out a list of questions and don’t let up until every one of them is addressed. If the specialist you’ve chosen can’t or won’t answer your questions, see that as a red flag, a clear sign that you need to get a second (or third) opinion

# Chapter 3: Strategic Questions

* What is the extent of the problem?
* What will it take to succeed?
* Are we up to the challenge?

Types of Strategic Questions

* *Get the big picture*.: Define the challenge or opportunity. Ask why it matters. Articulate the goal. Does it reflect your values? Who else cares? What are others prepared to do? 
* *Know what you’re up against.*: Recognize that you have a worthy opponent, whether it’s a person, place, or, in the Gates’s case, a disease. Give it credit. It’s the biggest obstacle that stands in your way.
* *Define your plan.*: Determine the tactics that will help you achieve your strategic goal. What are the next steps and the steps down the road? Who does what? And how will you measure success along the way?
* *Challenge yourself.*: Hold your plan or proposal up to the light and look for holes. Play out different scenarios. What haven’t you thought of? What can go wrong? 
* *Define success.* Can you explain what success looks like? How will you know it when you achieve it?

When taking controversial action, ask:

* Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed?
* Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?
* Do we have a clear and attainable objective?

When taking another possible job, ask yourself:

1. Do I have an obligation?
2. Do I really want to do it?
3. Do I have the passion to do it?
4. Do I have the organizational ability to do it?
5. Am I going to enjoy the work or be good at it?
6. What is my family’s view of this?

When considering a major decision:

* Does it feel right—is it important, consistent with my values?
* Do I have the passion to do this and stick with it?
* Can I define “success”?
* Do I have the tools to achieve it?
* Have I calculated costs and benefits, risks, rewards, and alternatives?
* What are the consequences for my emotional, intellectual, and spiritual well-being?
* Would the people closest to me think this is a good idea?
* If this ended up in my biography (or obituary), would I be proud to see it there?

## Chapter 4: Empathy Questions

Types of empathy questions:

* *Try new shoes*: Empathy involves taking the perspective of another person. What is he thinking? How is he feeling? If you switched places and stood in his shoes, what would you see?
* *Leave running room*: Start with big broad questions to get people talking. Invite them to engage on ground where they’re most comfortable and most familiar.
* *Listen beyond words*: The deeper you go, the more you need to listen for cues and tone and mood. Pauses and hesitation have meaning, too. So do body language, facial expressions, and eye contact.
* *Establish intimate distance*: Convey compassion and interest. But maintain enough distance and detachment so you don’t judge and can offer objective questions or advice.

You can ask questions about their childhood and find out, were they sick, were they well? Just all those things that create who you are.

## Chapter 5: Bridging Questions

Bridging questions are intended to encourage people to talk when they don’t want to. They coax information, glean detail, and assess intent and capability.

Your prospects of getting a closed person to open up is enhanced if you:

* *Know what you’re after*: Be clear about what you want to pursue and the nature of the problem. Have a focus and a destination in mind.
* *Avoid triggers*: Don’t start with accusations or questions that prompt defensiveness. Go instead for conversation. You want to open a channel of communication.
* *Don’t accuse, ask*: Start with the person’s grievance and inquire about it. What’s wrong? What’s unfair? 
* *Affirm and validate*: Walking someone across a bridge takes them farther than pushing them off a cliff. 

Echo questions enable you to use the other person’s own words for emphasis and as a follow-up question. Add inflection to suit the mood—sympathy, surprise, and humor.

Bridge-building questions work best when people are at cognitive ease and feel they have a receptive audience.

## Chapter 6: Confrontational Questions

*SOMETIMES YOU CAN’T BUILD BRIDGES.* You’re not looking for empathy and you’re not looking for trust. You just need an answer.

Confrontational questions work best when you:

* Know your goal: Set it and stick with it. Do you want an acknowledgment, an admission, an expression of regret or remorse, or a confession? Plot your question trajectory with your objective in mind. Anticipate what it will take to get there.
* Know your facts: Be sure they are complete and accurate. You need a solid foundation of information if you are going to accuse or confront. This is key to asking the right questions, anticipating the answers, and avoiding embarrassing mistakes.
* Frame your questions surgically: Precise answers are elicited with precise questions. Use direct questions. Frame them to support your case. Listen closely and ask again if you don’t get a direct answer.
* Care about the question: If you’re going into battle, you should be more than a mercenary. Your passion and your commitment will elevate the intensity and poignancy of the questions you ask. Craft your questions to project moral authority. Take the high road.
* Expect a defensive, evasive, or confrontational response: People don’t like to be called on the carpet and may ignore the question, duck the answer, or attack the messenger rather than acknowledge their fault or flaw. Be ready to rumble. Be prepared with a follow-up if this happens.

Before you confront somebody, ask yourself:

* Is confrontation called for?
* Are the questions clear and compelling?
* Am I willing to stake my reputation on them?

There are also several things to consider when confronting somebody:

* When and where to confront them
* Consider the value of the relationship
* Reflect on how you want to frame the questions

## Chapter 7: Creativity Questions

Creativity questions invite us to pull out the paintbrush, throw away the coloring book and think differently. They prompt our imaginations.

When asking creativity questions, you must:

* **Set sights unreasonably high**: Ask more of yourself and others without being limited by the laws of gravity. There will be plenty of time to come back to earth later.
* **Try a little time travel**: Creative thinking is all about the future, so go there. Put your questions in the future tense
* **Invoke imagined reality**: Role-play. You’re living in that new world, workplace, or community. What’s it like? Look up, down, 360 degrees around. What do you see?
* **Embrace disruption**: Questions that drive creativity involve disruptive thinking that can be unsettling, uncomfortable, and sometimes downright subversive.

What would you do if you knew you could not fail?

## Chapter 8: Mission Questions

Mission questions ask more of everybody. They help you draw people into a genuine conversation about shared goals and what everyone can bring to the task. They help you convey your priorities.

When you're pitching other people your mission, you must:

* **Identify your mission**: Determine interests and see where experiences intersect. What do you care about? What would you like to change or fix or build?
* **Share values**: Find out if you’re rowing to the same place. What are your bedrock principles? Where is your true north?
* **Play a role**: Figure out what each party adds to the equation. What are others prepared to do about the problem? 
* **Aim high**: People are excited by big ideas. How bold can we be? How will we change the world?

Ask about values and priorities. Find out what resonates and where your common interests lie. The answers may lead to collaboration and commitment.

* What are the guiding principles that have helped you in life?
* What do you hope to accomplish with your philanthropy?
* What values do you consistently support?

Once you've established your mission, ask yourself:

* What will your partnership look like?
* How far will you reach?
* Who will do what?
* What can you accomplish?

* What do we stand for?
* How do we deliver on the promise?

When talking to other people, some problems you might come up with include: 

* Are you an interrupter?
* Are you someone who has to drive a conversation; who has to fill silences and pauses?
* Does your mind wander?
* Do you look down and do email?
* Is it because you have trouble focusing or are just bored?
* Can you identify the types of conversations or the points along the way when your mind might wander?

## Chapter 9: Scientific Questions

When asking scientific questions, you should:

* **Observe a problem, frame a question**: Take what you see or know to be objectively and measurably true from the real world and ask a question. What’s going on here? What’s causing this?
* **Offer an explanation**: Based on your observations, your experiences, and the facts and data that exist, put together a clear hypothesis that could explain the situation.
* **Put your hypothesis to the test**: Experiment and measure over time. Try to prove yourself wrong. What else could explain this situation? What did you miss? What could be wrong with your approach and your data? If your hypothesis holds up, you are making progress.
* **Share**: If you think you’re onto something, shop it around and show it to other knowledgeable people. Let them review it. Do they see something that you didn’t? Do they have any problem with your data or your methods?

How can my idea be wrong?

## Chapter 10: Interview Questions

The first rule of the job interview: Don’t wing it. Preparation pays. Know what you’re talking about and to whom. Know as much as possible about the job. Have a list of questions on a pad and in your head. Think about where you’re going in the conversation, what you want to find out, and how you want to get there. 

Prepare a response for the following questions:

* Why are you interested in this position?
* What do you think you can do for us?
* What makes you qualified and unique?
* Why should we hire you?

To the astute interviewer, your tone will convey as much about you as the words you use, so strike a balance in how you present yourself. Talk about your successes without bragging, express confidence without sounding cocky, acknowledge your shortcomings without sounding insecure.

Some questions to ask the interviewer include:

* What’s the most successful project you’ve run?
* What is it about this job that interests you most?
* How does this job connect with your larger professional aspirations?

* If you had a magic wand here, what would you do with it?
* How would you work with different constituencies?
* What is your ambition for this institution and how would you achieve it?
* What would your detractors say about you?

Be ready for curveball questions that seem off-the-wall. 

Good questions to ask interviewers:

* What will be the hardest things to change?
* What are your traditions and what is sacred?
* What freedom do I have to step outside the defined role?
* What impact do you want to have in the world?
* Where does that stand as a priority in your business plan?

## Chapter 11: Entertaining Questions

What are the basic ingredients of entertaining questions?

* **Know your audience**: Who you are talking to? What have they done? Where have they been and what do they care about? Pick questions that intrigue and interest everyone.
* **Think creatively**: choose deliberately: Draw from a menu of topics and questions to create flow and distinctive moments. Sports or politics, fishing or sailing, it’s up to you, but you want a combination of topics that will engage different people on different levels. 
* **Set a mood and set a rhythm**: Funny or serious? Provocative or reflective?
* **Engage emotion**: You trigger emotions through the subjects you pick and the questions you ask. Serious or snide? Funny or flippant? 

Some questions include:

* What is something you see in your world that blows you away right now?
* What’s one thing you want everyone to know about you?
* If you could transport yourself anywhere in the world right now, go to any country just to eat dinner, where would you go and what would you eat?
* Or, what is obvious in your world that to the rest of us may be extremely unobvious?

Politics, religion, and money will inspire some but turn into disasters with others. Know the difference and navigate deliberately.

## Chapter 12: Legacy Questions

* What are you proudest of in life?
* What’s one story you’d like me to tell my grandchildren about you?
* What have I accomplished?
* How do I want people to remember me?
* What brings you meaning at this time in your life?
* What kinds of things do you think you’ll miss the most?
* What are the intangible gifts you have now because of your experience with this person?
* What are you proudest of?
* What is the most important life lesson you have learned?
* What is your unfinished business?
* What is your story?

## Chapter 13: I'm glad I asked

In some societies, questions are viewed as an outright threat. Repressive regimes know they cannot stand up to scrutiny or challenge. Thought dictatorships reject accountability and suppress curiosity.

Benjamin Franklin had said, “It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority.”

* Does money matter?
* How much is too much?
* Is there something you believe in so strongly that you would give your life for it?
* How do you know if you have had a successful life?

Inquiry is the sincerest form of flattery. Ask a good question and you convey interest. Slow down, listen closely, and ask more and you engage at a deeper level.

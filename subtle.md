# The suble art of not giving a F**K by Mark Manson
## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Chapter 1

Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.

Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations

We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me?
 
Stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years, despite the fact that everyone has a flat-screen TV and can have their groceries delivered.
 
The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires

1. It doesn't mean being indifferent. It means being comfortable with being different
2. To not care about adversity, you must first care about something more than adversity
3. You are always chasing what to care about

## Chapter 2

Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and, as we’ll see, necessary components to creating consistent happiness. 

Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we’re young or careless. It helps show us what’s good for us versus what’s bad for us.

Happiness comes from solving problems. 

People who don't want to deal with their problems will:

1. Have denial about their problems and pretend they don't exist
2. Have a victim mentality and choose to believe that they can't solve their problems
 
Negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something.

Most people want to get the corner office and make a boatload of money—but not many people want to suffer through sixty-hour workweeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, and arbitrary corporate hierarchies to escape the confines of an infinite cubicle hell.

People don't like to climb much. They just like to imagine the summit.

## Chapter 3

Merely feeling good about yourself doesn’t really mean anything unless you have a good reason to feel good about yourself.

Entitled people, because they are incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly, are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way.

Construing everything in life so as to make yourself out to be constantly victimized requires just as much selfishness as the opposite. It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all.

The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average.

Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems.

A lot of people are afraid to accept mediocrity because they believe that if they accept it, they’ll never achieve anything, never improve, and that their life won’t matter.

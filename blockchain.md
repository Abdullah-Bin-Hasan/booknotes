#The Business Blockchain by William Mougayar
##Notes by Christopher Durr

#Chapter 1: What is the Blockchain?

Defininitions: 

* Business: Back-end database that maintains a distributed ledger, openly.
* Technical: Exchange network for moving value between peers.
* Legal: A transaction validation mechanism, not requiring intermediary assistance.

Blockchain will remain a semi-mysterious, semi-complex phenomena for the period 2015–2018

The blockchain is changing how we write applications via a new form of scripting languages that can program business logic as smart contracts that are enforced on the blockchain.

A “hash” is a unique fingerprint that helps to verify that a certain piece of information has not been altered, without the need to actually see it.
 
The blockchain exhibits simultaneously the following ten properties:

1. Cryptocurrency
2. Computing Infrastructure
3. Transaction Platform
4. Decentralized Database
5. Distributed Accounting Ledger
6. Development Platform
7. Open Source Software
8. Financial Services Marketplace
9. Peer-to-Peer Network
10. Trust Services Layer

As cryptocurrency gains more acceptance and understanding, its future will be less uncertain, resulting in a more stable and gradual adoption curve.
 
The more open the core of a blockchain is, the stronger the ecosystem around it will become.
 
A strong contender to POW will be the Proof-of-Stake (POS) algorithm which relies on the concept of virtual mining and token-based voting

## Chapter 2: How Blockchain Infiltrates Trust

The blockchain offers a degree of transparency and access to truth that can prevent breaches of trust. 
 
On the blockchain, identity and reputation are the primary entry-level factors that effectively lock the peer-to-peer transaction in place.

Smart contracts help make the breach of an agreement expensive because they control a real-world valuable property via “digital means.”

Writing a simple contract is easy, especially if you are using a specific smart contract language 

mart oracles contain a real-world representation of information, such as an identity, an address, or a certificate, and they could also have agent-like property that directs the smart contract to behave in a certain way.

Examples: Netki, OneName, BitID, Identifi.

Consensus in public blockchains is done publicly, and is theoretically subject to the proverbial Sybil attacks 

Web3 architecture includes: 1) an advanced browser as the client, 2) the blockchain ledger as a shared resource, and 3) a virtual network of computers that runs smart business logic programs in a decentralized way

The World Wide Web’s original Hypertext Protocol is getting augmented by a new hypermedia protocol called InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)

## Chapter 3: Obstacles, Challenges, and Mental Blocks

The blockchain will meet resistance, be misunderstood and rejected, until it is widely accepted. 

Popularity of certification programs, such as from the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4)

There is a lack of standards when it comes to the blockchain

Crowdfunding by self-issuing cryptocurrency or crypto-tokens is also another funding option

There is not a lot of difference with the Internet’s situation, back in 1997, when we knocked down all these barriers one by one, while some of them went away on their own.

## Chapter 4: Blockchain in Financial Services

Bitcoin’s vision is a globally decentralized money network with users at the edges of it.

The decentralization of banking is here. It just has not been evenly distributed yet.

Here is a summary of the dilemma. Banks do not want to change banking. Startups want to change banking. Blockchain wants to change the world.

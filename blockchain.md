#The Business Blockchain by William Mougayar
##Notes by Christopher Durr

#Chapter 1: What is the Blockchain?

Defininitions: 

* Business: Back-end database that maintains a distributed ledger, openly.
* Technical: Exchange network for moving value between peers.
* Legal: A transaction validation mechanism, not requiring intermediary assistance.

Blockchain will remain a semi-mysterious, semi-complex phenomena for the period 2015–2018

The blockchain is changing how we write applications via a new form of scripting languages that can program business logic as smart contracts that are enforced on the blockchain.

A “hash” is a unique fingerprint that helps to verify that a certain piece of information has not been altered, without the need to actually see it.
 
The blockchain exhibits simultaneously the following ten properties:

1. Cryptocurrency
2. Computing Infrastructure
3. Transaction Platform
4. Decentralized Database
5. Distributed Accounting Ledger
6. Development Platform
7. Open Source Software
8. Financial Services Marketplace
9. Peer-to-Peer Network
10. Trust Services Layer

 As cryptocurrency gains more acceptance and understanding, its future will be less uncertain, resulting in a more stable and gradual adoption curve.
 
 The more open the core of a blockchain is, the stronger the ecosystem around it will become.
 
 A strong contender to POW will be the Proof-of-Stake (POS) algorithm which relies on the concept of virtual mining and token-based voting

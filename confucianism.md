# Analects of Confucius
## Notes by Christopher Durr

Note: This is not a representation of the entirety of my beliefs and faiths. These notes simply serve as a reference to understand other cultures. 

## Book 1

Proper behavior towards parents and elder brothers is the trunk of goodness

Avoid clever talk or a pretentious manner

Every day ask yourself:

1. When interacting with others, are you loyal to their best interests?
2. When with friends have you been true to your word?

Be cautious in giving promises and be punctual in keeping them

Be faithful to superiors, and refuse toxic friendships

Do not demand comfort in your own home. Be diligent in business and cautious in speech. 

Do not grieve that others do not recognize your merits. You should instead recognize the merits of others. 

## Book 2 

Let there be no evil in your thoughts

Behave so your parents have no anxiety about you, except for your health

Apply old knowledge to gain solutions to new problems

Do not be a specialist

He who learns but does not think is lost. He who thinks but does not learn is in danger. 

Knowledge is recognizing when you know or do not know a thing. 

Seeing what is right and not doing it is cowardice.

## Book 3

Always be too sparing rather than too lavish

Do not compete. Make way for one another. 

If you are not present at a sacrifice, it is as though there was no sacrifice. 

Do not discuss, critize, or censure what is over and done with. 

## Book 4

Dislike nobody 

If wealth and status can only be obtained illegaly, relinquish it. 

Do not be ashamed of wearing shabby clothes and eating coarse food. 

Loyalty, and consideration is the way. 

When in the presence of a good person, constantly ask yourself how you may learn to equal him

Have a reputation of being slow in word but prompt in action. 

Repeated scolding can lead to loss of friendship or favor. 

## Book 5

Do not run for office until you perfect yourself in the virtue of good faith

Don't only listen to what people have to say but keep an eye on what they do

Do not be afraid to pick up knowledge, even from those below you

Thinking twice before acting is good enough

Do not stoop to clever talk and a pretentious manner

When dealing with those older than you, comfort them. Cherish those younger than you

## Book 6

Strictly follow the path

Belittle your own achievements

Delight in the way rather than prefer it. Prefer it rather than know it. 

Be in moderation. To exceed is as bad as to fall short. 

If you want to get rank and standing, then help others get rank and standing

## Book 7

Seek distraction in the arts

Burst with eagerness and excitement

If you are next to somebody in mourning while eating, do not eat your food

If you have a means of escaping poverty that does not involve doing wrong, do it even if it is menial work

Seek only coarse food to eat, water to drink, and a pillow for sleep to find happiness

Do not talk of prodigies, feats of strength, disorders of nature, or spirits

Even when with three people you can learn something from them by imitating their good qualities. 

Have an unwearying effort to learn and patience in teaching others

A true gentleman is calm and at ease. A small man is fretful and ill at ease

## Book 8

Be generous with others

Follow these three things the most:

1. Remove any traces of violence or arrogance
2. Every look on your face must have good faith
3. Remove all coarseness from every word and intonation you speak

Do not be ashamed to consult those less clever than you, or with fewer gifts than you. 

If you have many gifts and talents but you are arrogant and rude, it is worthless

If you do not hold a political position in an area, do not discuss its policies. 
you were 

Learn as if it were someone you were frightened of losing. 

## Book 9

Have these four traits:

1. Never take anything for granted
2. Never be over-positive
3. Never obstinate
4. Never egotistic

There is no need for practical accomplishments

Ones moral strivings could never cease, always trying to accomplish more and be better

"There are shoots whose lot it is to spring up but never flower; others whose lot it is to flower, but never bear fruit"

Respect the young

If you made a mistake, do not be afraid of admitting the fact and amending your ways

Men fail to attain goodness because they do not care for it sufficiently because it is far away. 

The three most important traits, in order of importance:

1. Goodness
2. Wisdom
3. Bravery

## Book 10

At home have a simple and unassuming manner

When conversing with those under you, be friendly. To those above, be restrained and formal.

If a friend dies and there are no relative for them to fall back on, say "the funeral is my affair"

## Book 11

To go too far is as bad as not to go far enough

He who does not tread in the tracks (of the ancients) cannot find his way into the inner room

When one hears a maxim, they should put it into practice immediately

Learning consists in other things besides reading books

## Book 12

He who can submit to ritual is good

Always behave as though you were in the presence of an important guest. Do not do to others what you would not want yourself

Do not grieve or fear

If a person attends to business and does not idle away his time, if he behaves with care to others, then all within the bound universe will be his

People that no longer trust their ruler is lost

Take loyalty and good faith as your guiding principle

Never sleep over a promise -- never agree to anything. That could not be done until the next day.

Call attention to the good points in others, not to their defects

Influential is different from famous. To be influential, be straightforward and do what is right. Examine men's words and observe their expressions. This will make a person certain to win fame in a state. 

Work first, reward afterwards. Attack the evil within yourself

Inform your friends loyally and guide them discreetly. 

## Book 13

Lead and encourage people untiringly

Get as much possible done first by your subordinates. Pardon small offences. Promote men of superior capacity. Those who are of superior capacity will bring themselves to your notice. 

Use only proper language for speech. When speaking and doing other things, leaving nothing to mere chance. 

Once a man puts himself aright, he will find no difficulty at all in filling any government post. But if he cannot put himself aright, how can he hope to succeed in putting others right?

If you let yourself be distracted by minor things, nothing important will ever get finished. 

Expect of people only what they are capable of performing. 

## Book 14

Have neither love of mastery, vanity, resentment nor covetousness to be good. 

To be poor and not resent it is far harder than to be rich yet not presumptuous. 

Do not be too ready to speak of goodness. 

A gentleman can influence those above him. 

It used to be that men studied for the sake of self-improvement. Now men study to impress other people. 

Do not let your words outrun your deeds. 

Be diligent in your tasks and ease the lot of other people. 

## Book 15

A gentleman can withstand hardships

Be loyal and true to your every word, serious and careful in all you do. Do not be disloyal and untrustworthy in your speech or frivolous and careless in your acts. 

He who is truly wise never wastes a man

To do good, first sharpen your tools

A gentleman is distressed by his own lack of capacity; he is never distressed at the failure of others to recognize his merits. 

Be proud but not quarrelsome, and ally yourself with individuals, not parties

Do not reject sayings because of who the speaker is. 

"Never do to others what you would not like them to do to you"

When everyone dislikes or likes a man, enquiry is necessary. 

To have faults and make not effort to amend them is to have faults. 

Be intent upon the task, not bent upon the pay

# Analects of Confucius
## Notes by Christopher Durr

Note: This is not a representation of the entirety of my beliefs and faiths. These notes simply serve as a reference to understand other cultures. 

# Book 1

Proper behavior towards parents and elder brothers is the trunk of goodness

Avoid clever talk or a pretentious manner

Every day ask yourself:

1. When interacting with others, are you loyal to their best interests?
2. When with friends have you been true to your word?

Be cautious in giving promises and be punctual in keeping them

Be faithful to superiors, and refuse toxic friendships

Do not demand comfort in your own home. Be diligent in business and cautious in speech. 

Do not grieve that others do not recognize your merits. You should instead recognize the merits of others. 

## Book 2 

Let there be no evil in your thoughts

Behave so your parents have no anxiety about you, except for your health

Apply old knowledge to gain solutions to new problems

Do not be a specialist

He who learns but does not think is lost. He who thinks but does not learn is in danger. 

Knowledge is recognizing when you know or do not know a thing. 

Seeing what is right and not doing it is cowardice.

## Book 3

Always be too sparing rather than too lavish

Do not compete. Make way for one another. 

If you are not present at a sacrifice, it is as though there was no sacrifice. 

Do not discuss, critize, or censure what is over and done with. 

## Book 4

Dislike nobody 

If wealth and status can only be obtained illegaly, relinquish it. 

Do not be ashamed of wearing shabby clothes and eating coarse food. 

Loyalty, and consideration is the way. 

When in the presence of a good person, constantly ask yourself how you may learn to equal him

Have a reputation of being slow in word but prompt in action. 

Repeated scolding can lead to loss of friendship or favor. 

## Book 5

Do not run for office until you perfect yourself in the virtue of good faith

Don't only listen to what people have to say but keep an eye on what they do

Do not be afraid to pick up knowledge, even from those below you

Thinking twice before acting is good enough

Do not stoop to clever talk and a pretentious manner

When dealing with those older than you, comfort them. Cherish those younger than you

## Book 6

Strictly follow the path

Belittle your own achievements

Delight in the way rather than prefer it. Prefer it rather than know it. 

Be in moderation. To exceed is as bad as to fall short. 

If you want to get rank and standing, then help others get rank and standing

## Book 7

Seek distraction in the arts

Burst with eagerness and excitement

If you are next to somebody in mourning while eating, do not eat your food

If you have a means of escaping poverty that does not involve doing wrong, do it even if it is menial work

Seek only coarse food to eat, water to drink, and a pillow for sleep to find happiness

Do not talk of prodigies, feats of strength, disorders of nature, or spirits

Even when with three people you can learn something from them by imitating their good qualities. 

Have an unwearying effort to learn and patience in teaching others

A true gentleman is calm and at ease. A small man is fretful and ill at ease

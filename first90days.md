## Chapter 1: Prepare Yourself

It’s a mistake to believe that you will be successful in your new job by continuing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so.

No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process.

Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence. 

Establish new channels for communicating your strategic intent and vision across the organization—convening town-hall–type meetings rather than individual or small-group sessions, or using electronic communication to broadcast your messages to the widest possible audiences.

Transitioning leaders should use this checklist to help them figure out how things really work in the organizations they’re joining.
* **Influence.** How do people get support for critical initiatives? Is it more important to have the support of a patron within the senior team, or affirmation from your peers and direct reports that your idea is a good one?
* **Meetings.** Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private?
* **Execution.** When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people?
* **Conflict.** Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution? Or do they avoid conflict—or, even worse, push it to lower levels, where it can wreak havoc?
* **Recognition.** Does the company promote stars, rewarding those who visibly and vocally drive business initiatives? Or does it encourage team players, rewarding those who lead authoritatively but quietly and collaboratively?
* **Ends versus means.** Are there any restrictions on how you achieve results? Does the organization have a well-defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives?

1. If you have been promoted, what are the implications for your need to balance breadth and depth, delegate, influence, communicate, and exhibit leadership presence?
2. If you are joining a new organization, how will you orient yourself to the business, identify and connect with key stakeholders, clarify expectations, and adapt to the new culture? What is the right balance between adapting to the new situation and trying to alter it?
3. What has made you successful so far in your career? Can you succeed in your new position by relying solely on those strengths? If not, what are the critical skills you need to develop?
4. Are there aspects of your new job that are critical to success but that you prefer not to focus on? Why? How will you compensate for your potential blind spots?
5. How can you ensure that you make the mental leap into the new position? From whom might you seek advice and counsel on this? What other activities might help you do this?

## Chapter 2: Accelerate your learning

### Questions About the Past**

**Performance**

How has this organization performed in the past? How do people in the organization think it has performed?
How were goals set? Were they insufficiently or overly ambitious?
Were internal or external benchmarks used?
What measures were employed? What behaviors did they encourage and discourage?
What happened if goals were not met?

**Root Causes**

If performance has been good, why has that been the case?
What have been the relative contributions of strategy, structure, systems, talent bases, culture, and politics?
If performance has been poor, why has that been the case? Do the primary issues reside in the organization’s strategy? Its structure? Its technical capabilities? Its culture? Its politics?

**History of Change**

What efforts have been made to change the organization? What happened?
Who has been instrumental in shaping this organization?

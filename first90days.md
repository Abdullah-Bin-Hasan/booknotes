# The First 90 Days

## Chapter 1: Prepare Yourself

It’s a mistake to believe that you will be successful in your new job by continuing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so.

No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process.

Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence. 

Establish new channels for communicating your strategic intent and vision across the organization—convening town-hall–type meetings rather than individual or small-group sessions, or using electronic communication to broadcast your messages to the widest possible audiences.

Transitioning leaders should use this checklist to help them figure out how things really work in the organizations they’re joining.
* **Influence.** How do people get support for critical initiatives? Is it more important to have the support of a patron within the senior team, or affirmation from your peers and direct reports that your idea is a good one?
* **Meetings.** Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private?
* **Execution.** When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people?
* **Conflict.** Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution? Or do they avoid conflict—or, even worse, push it to lower levels, where it can wreak havoc?
* **Recognition.** Does the company promote stars, rewarding those who visibly and vocally drive business initiatives? Or does it encourage team players, rewarding those who lead authoritatively but quietly and collaboratively?
* **Ends versus means.** Are there any restrictions on how you achieve results? Does the organization have a well-defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives?

1. If you have been promoted, what are the implications for your need to balance breadth and depth, delegate, influence, communicate, and exhibit leadership presence?
2. If you are joining a new organization, how will you orient yourself to the business, identify and connect with key stakeholders, clarify expectations, and adapt to the new culture? What is the right balance between adapting to the new situation and trying to alter it?
3. What has made you successful so far in your career? Can you succeed in your new position by relying solely on those strengths? If not, what are the critical skills you need to develop?
4. Are there aspects of your new job that are critical to success but that you prefer not to focus on? Why? How will you compensate for your potential blind spots?
5. How can you ensure that you make the mental leap into the new position? From whom might you seek advice and counsel on this? What other activities might help you do this?

## Chapter 2: Accelerate your learning

### Questions About the Past

**Performance**

* How has this organization performed in the past? How do people in the organization think it has performed?
* How were goals set? Were they insufficiently or overly ambitious?
* Were internal or external benchmarks used?
* What measures were employed? What behaviors did they encourage and discourage?
* What happened if goals were not met?

**Root Causes**

* If performance has been good, why has that been the case?
* What have been the relative contributions of strategy, structure, systems, talent bases, culture, and politics?
* If performance has been poor, why has that been the case? Do the primary issues reside in the organization’s strategy? Its structure? Its technical capabilities? Its culture? Its politics?

**History of Change**

* What efforts have been made to change the organization? What happened?
* Who has been instrumental in shaping this organization?

### Questions About the Present

**Vision and Strategy**

* What is the stated vision and strategy?
* Is the organization really pursuing that strategy? If not, why not? If so, will the strategy take the organization where it needs to go?

**People**

* Who is capable, and who is not?
* Who is trustworthy, and who is not?
* Who has influence, and why?

**Processes**

* What are the key processes?
* Are they performing acceptably in quality, reliability, and timeliness? If not, why not?

**Land Mines**

* What lurking surprises could detonate and push you offtrack?
* What potentially damaging cultural or political missteps must you avoid?

**Early Wins**

* In what areas (people, relationships, processes, or products) can you achieve some early wins?

### Questions About the Future

**Challenges and Opportunities**

* In what areas is the organization most likely to face stiff challenges in the coming year? What can be done now to prepare for them?
* What are the most promising unexploited opportunities? What would need to happen to realize their potential?

**Barriers and Resources**

* What are the most formidable barriers to making needed changes? Are they technical? Cultural? Political?
* Are there islands of excellence or other high-quality resources that you can leverage?
* What new capabilities need to be developed or acquired?

**Culture**

* Which elements of the culture should be preserved?
* Which elements need to change?

### Learning Plan Template

**Before Entry**

* Find out whatever you can about the organization’s strategy, structure, performance, and people.
* Look for external assessments of the performance of the organization. You will learn how knowledgeable, fairly unbiased people view it. If you are a manager at a lower level, talk to people who deal with your new group as suppliers or customers.
* Find external observers who know the organization well, including former employees, recent retirees, and people who have transacted business with the organization. Ask these people open-ended questions about history, politics, and culture. Talk with your predecessor if possible.
* Talk to your new boss.
* As you begin to learn about the organization, write down your first impressions and eventually some hypotheses.
* Compile an initial set of questions to guide your structured inquiry after you arrive.

**Soon after Entry**

* Meet one-on-one with your direct reports and ask them the questions you compiled. You will learn about convergent and divergent views and about your reports as people.
* Assess how things are going at key interfaces. You will hear how salespeople, purchasing agents, customer service representatives, and others perceive your organization’s dealings with external constituencies. You will also learn about problems they see that others do not.
* Test strategic alignment from the top down. Ask people at the top what the company’s vision and strategy are. Then see how far down into the organizational hierarchy those beliefs penetrate. You will learn how well the previous leader drove vision and strategy down through the organization.
* Test awareness of challenges and opportunities from the bottom up. Start by asking frontline people how they view the company’s challenges and opportunities. Then work your way up. You will learn how well the people at the top check the pulse of the organization.
* Update your questions and hypotheses.
* Meet with your boss to discuss your hypotheses and findings.

**By the End of the First Month**

* Gather your team to feed back to them your preliminary findings. You will elicit confirmation and challenges of your assessments and will learn more about the group and its dynamics.
* Now analyze key interfaces from the outside in. You will learn how people on the outside (suppliers, customers, distributors, and others) perceive your organization and its strengths and weaknesses.
* Analyze a couple of key processes. Convene representatives of the responsible groups to map out and evaluate the processes you selected. You will learn about productivity, quality, and reliability.
* Meet with key integrators. You will learn how things work at interfaces among functional areas. What problems do they perceive that others do not? Seek out the natural historians. They can fill you in on the history, culture, and politics of the organization, and they are also potential allies and influencers.
* Update your questions and hypotheses.
* Meet with your boss again to discuss your observations.

## Chapter 3: Match Strategy to Situation

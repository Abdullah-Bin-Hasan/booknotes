# The Telomere Effect by Eppel and Blackburn
## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Introduction

Why do people age at different rates?

Our healthspan is the number of years of our healthy life. Our diseasespan is the years we live with noticeable disease that interferes with our quality of living.

In some cases, lifestyle factors can turn genes on or shut them off. 

Telomeres, which shorten with each cell division, help determine how fast your cells age and when they die, depending on how quickly they wear down.

Senescent cells can leak proinflammatory substances that make you vulnerable to more pain, more chronic illness. Eventually, many senescent cells will undergo a preprogrammed death.

Age is by far the largest determinant of chronic diseases.

# Part 1: Telomeres, a pathway to living longer

1. How old do I look?
* I look younger than my age.
* I look about my age.
* I look older than my age.

2. How would I rate my physical health?
* I’m in better health than most people my age.
* I’m about as healthy as most people my age.
* I’m less healthy than most people my age.
3. How old do I feel?
* I feel younger than my age.
* I feel about my age.
* I feel older than my age.

Studies show that people who feel older than their biological age also tend to be sicker earlier than people who feel younger.

Some cells have a limit to how many times they can divide. When cells can no longer renew themselves, the body tissues they supply will start to age and function poorly.

Aging can be defined as the cell’s “progressive functional impairment and reduced capacity to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli and injuries.” 

A healthy level of bone density results when you have a balance between the bone-building cells (osteoblasts) and the bone-busting cells (osteoclasts).

Each strand of hair begins inside its own follicle and is made from keratin, which produces a white hair. But there are special cells inside the follicle—melanocytes, the same kinds of cells responsible for skin color—that inject the hair with pigment

Chronic inflammation is also a factor in heart disease, brain diseases, gum disease, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hepatitis, cancers, and more. That’s why scientists talk about inflamm-aging. It’s real.

Short telomeres may help cause Alzheimer’s directly.

When you catch yourself thinking of old age negatively, remind yourself of the positive side of aging

People with more emotional complexity also have a longer healthspan

If you think of aging in a positive way, odds are that you’ll live seven and a half years longer than someone who doesn’t, at least according to one study

## Chapter 2: The power of long telomeres

That variability in the lengths of the ends turns out to be one of the factors that explains why some of us live longer and healthier than others.

Tetrahymena (Pond Scum) provided the first precious information about telomeres, telomerase, and a cell’s life span.

Telomeres on average grew shorter and shorter as people progressed from their twenties, hitting rock bottom at around age seventy-five

People with the longest telomeres are the healthiest, and as telomeres get shorter, people get sicker and are more likely to die.
 
People with shorter telomeres are more likely to have a chronic disease, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, impaired immune function, and certain types of cancers
 
## Chapter 3: Telomerase, the Enzyme That Replenishes Telomeres

Telomerase creates new telomeres patterned on its own biochemical sequence. It can slow, prevent, or even reverse the shortening of telomeres that comes with cell division. 

Tetrahymena cells have telomerase in sufficient quantities so that they can constantly rebuild their telomeres. 

You may potentially increase the chance of developing any of a number of different cancers (such as melanomas or brain and lung cancers). Knowing this, it comes as no surprise that our cells keep their telomerase on a tight rein.

Some types of cancers are more likely to develop when too little available telomerase makes telomeres too short

It showed that the more stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres and the lower your telomerase levels.
 
# Part 2: Your cells are listening to your thoughts

## Chapter 4: How stress gets into your cells

Caregivers often feel unappreciated and become isolated. Health researchers have identified them as one of the most chronically stressed groups of people.

Short-term, manageable stressors can be good for you, because they build your coping muscles. You develop skills and confidence that you can handle challenges

Serious traumas, both recent and in childhood, have also been linked to damaged telomeres. These traumas include rape, abuse, domestic violence, and prolonged bullying.

The threat response causes your blood vessels to constrict so that you’ll bleed less if you’re wounded, but also less blood flows to your brain. 

Be hopeful. When you can’t control the difficult or stressful events in your life, you can still help protect your telomeres by shifting the way you view those events.

When researchers put people through lab stressors, the ones who are told to think of stress as useful are able to maintain their social equilibrium. 
Instead of looking away, playing with their hair, or fidgeting—all signs of feeling somewhat threatened—the challenge participants make direct eye contact. Their shoulders are relaxed, and their bodies move fluidly. They feel less anxiety and shame.
All these benefits happened simply because people were told to think of their stress as good for them.

T-cells look for cells that are either infected or cancerous

Exposing immune cells to the stress hormone cortisol dampens their levels of telomerase

Your telomeres don’t sweat the small stuff. Toxic stress, on the other hand, is something to watch for. Toxic stress is severe stress that lasts for years. Toxic stress can dampen down telomerase and shorten telomeres.

**Tips for reducing stress**

Think about an upcoming stressful task using the third person

The next time a threat looms, pause and list what’s most important to you. 

Next time you are in the grip of a stressful event, ask yourself, *In ten years, will this event still have an impact on me?*

## Chapter 5

We are largely unaware of the mental chatter in our minds and how it affects us. Certain thought patterns appear to be unhealthy for telomeres. These include thought suppression and rumination as well as the negative thinking that characterizes hostility and pessimism.

Being a quick-on-the-draw high achiever is not necessarily harmful to your health. It’s the hostility component of type A that is so damaging. People who score high on measures of cynical hostility often cope passively by eating, drinking, and smoking more.

We spend half of the day thinking about something other than what we’re doing.

Women with the highest levels of self-reported mind wandering (low present-oriented focus along with wanting to be somewhere else) had telomeres that were shorter by around two hundred base pairs. This was regardless of how much stress they had in their lives.

The most efficient use of time is to do one thing and to pay full attention to it.

When you ruminate, you are actually less effective at solving problems, and you feel much, much worse.
How do you tell rumination from harmless reflection? Reflection is the natural curious, introspective, or philosophical analysis about why things happen a certain way. Reflection may cause you some healthy discomfort, especially if you are thinking about something you wish you hadn’t done. But rumination feels awful. You can’t stop yourself, even if you try. And it doesn’t lead to a solution, only to more ruminating.

People who ruminate experience more depression and anxiety

You don’t need to believe your negative thoughts, or act on them, or have a lot of bad feelings because the thoughts crossed your mind.

Upon waking—and before mentally jumping into your to-do list—see what it feels like to think “I am alive!” and welcome in the day. 
Stronger feelings of life purpose are also related to reduced risk of stroke and improved functioning of immune cells. Life purpose is even linked to less belly fat and lower insulin sensitivity. In addition, having a higher purpose in life may inspire us to take better care of ourselves.

Life purpose is what brings us eudaemonic happiness, the healthy feeling that we are involved in something bigger than ourselves.

Conscientiousness in childhood predicts longevity decades later, and in a study of Medicare patients, those with high self-discipline lived 34 percent longer than their less conscientious counterparts.

When you fail at something important to you, do you berate yourself? Do you become consumed by feelings of inadequacy? Are you judgmental about your flaws? Do you feel isolated and alone, separate from other people?
If you’ve answered yes to these, it’s a sign that you struggle to feel compassionate toward yourself. Self-compassion is a skill you can develop.

**Tombstone Exercise**

Write down the epitaph you’d like to see on your tombstone, the few words that you’d like the world to remember you by. To get ideas flowing, first ask yourself, what are you deeply passionate about? It forces you to articulate the one or two principles that are the most important to you. 

If you say yes to positive stress, close your eyes and think of what is at the top of your list. Take some time to think of something both exciting and feasible, a mini-adventure. Choose a small step toward that goal, something you can look into today. 

## Chapter 6: When blue turns to gray, depression and anxiety

Clinical depression and anxiety are linked to shorter telomeres—and the more severe these disorders are, the shorter your telomeres.

Mental disorders and substance abuse are the top causes of disability (defined as “productive days of life lost”) worldwide, and the biggest player in this mix of disorders is depression

Research has demonstrated that these states reach past your mind and soul, past your heart, past your bloodstream, and all the way into your cells.

The more that telomerase goes up, the more likely it is that a person's depression will lift

Depressed people try to suppress the bad feelings so that they can’t be deeply felt, or they keep their problems alive by ruminating about them over and over and over. They criticize themselves. They feel irritable and angry, not just at whatever circumstances have caused their sorrow and stress, but at the fact of feeling sorrow and stress.

The problem with avoiding whatever is making you anxious is that the avoidance actually perpetuates the feelings of anxiety.

MBCT is potent against that great threat to your telomeres, major depression. It’s been shown to be as effective as an antidepressant. 80 percent of depression sufferers experience a recurrence, however MBCT slashes the risk of depression’s return in half

Stress reducing techniques to boost telomere maintenance:

1. Meditation retreats
2. MBSR
3. Yoga: Practicing Kirtan Kriya for 12 min./day increased telomerase by 43%
4. Yogic Meditation: Yoga has recently been shown to increase spine bone density if practiced long term
5. Qigong: Reduces depression and may improve diabetes

# Part 3: Help your body protect its cells

## Chapter 7: Training your Telomeres, how much exercise is enough?

Overtraining syndrome is an unofficial diagnosis that is characterized by sleep changes, fatigue, moodiness, vulnerability to illness, and physical pain.

People who exercise live longer and have a lowered risk of high blood pressure, stroke, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome as well as avoid dementia for longer.

Oxidative stress is a state that can shear through a cell’s molecular population. It’s associated with aging and onset of the diseasespan: cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung problems, arthritis, diabetes, macular degeneration, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Immunosenescence is an important process underlying increased sickness and malignancy as we age. Immunosenescence is a natural process that happens with age… but people who exercise may be able to delay it until the end of life. 

Those who increased their aerobic fitness the most had greater increases in telomerase activity

When endurance athletes are compared to more ordinary runners, who might run around ten miles a week, you find that both groups have nice, healthy telomeres compared to the more sedentary group

Begin any exercise program slowly, gradually working up to better fitness. Weekend warriors who sit in the office for five days and then overdo it on the weekend, pushing themselves to break down a lot of muscle at once, will feel fatigued and sometimes even nauseated. 

**Walking Workout**

Interval (repeat 4 times):

1. Walk fast (on a exertion scale of 1 to 10, be at a 6 or 7): 3 minutes
2. Stroll gently: 3 minutes

## Chapter 8: Tired Telomeres, from exhaustion to restoration

Poor quality sleep, sleep debt, and sleep disorders are all linked to shorter telomeres. 

Are you getting enough sleep? Ask yourself whether you’re sleepy during the day. If you are, you need more sleep

By getting light exposure during the day, and by dimming the lights at night, you keep your SCN on schedule. If you keep to regular eating and sleeping times, you also give your SCN the information it needs to inhibit the sleep drive during the day and unleash that drive throughout the night.

A bad night of sleep can throw you into a temporary prediabetic state
 
REM sleep shuts off some of the stimulating chemicals in your brain and allows you to split off your emotions from the content of the memory. With time, this action allows you to remember a painful experience but without an intense jolt to your mind and body.

*Getting at least seven hours of sleep or more is associated with longer telomeres, especially if you are older.*

One method that’s been shown to help with this second layer of thoughts is to examine them directly. 

The blue light from screens can suppress melatonin, the sleepiness hormone. 

Gently remind yourself that unless you’re a new parent or a caregiver, your bedtime is one of the few areas of sleep you can control.

Severe sleep apnea, the repeated cessation of breathing during sleep, has been linked to shorter telomeres in adults

Spend 5 minutes in a transition period before you go to sleep without screens by meditating or reading. 

## Chapter 9: Telomeres weigh in, a healthy metabolism

Dieting may not be the way to get healthier.

People with belly fat develop shorter telomeres over the years,5 and it’s very possible that these short telomeres worsen the insulin resistance problem.

Improving your metabolic health is more important than losing weight
 
Fewer than 5 percent of people who are trying to lose weight can stick to a diet and maintain the weight loss for five years.

Instead of dieting by restricting calories, focus on being physically active and eating nutritious foods

**Renewal**

Cutting back on sugar is the single most beneficial change you can make to your diet

Stress, boredom, and emotions (even happy ones) can make you feel as if you’re hungry even when you’re really not.

## Chapter 10: Food and Telomeres, eating for optimal health

Glucose absorbed from refined carbohydrates white bread, white rice, pasta, and from sugary candies, sodas, juices, and most baked goods, hits your bloodstream fast and hard. That uptick of blood glucose also causes an increase in cytokines, which are inflammatory messengers.

Anti-inflammatory foods include oily fish, nuts, flaxseed, flax oil, and leafy vegetables—because all these items are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. 

Keep eating healthy, unprocessed foods like nuts and seeds but dramatically reduce your consumption of fried foods, packaged crackers, cookies, chips, and snacks, which often contain oils made with high amounts of omega-6s, as well as saturated fats, which are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease

People who drink twenty ounces of sugary soda daily have the equivalent of 4.6 extra years of biological aging

To prevent insulin spikes that can eventually lead to insulin resistance, focus on foods that are higher in fiber: Whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, barley, seeds, vegetables, and fruits are all excellent sources.

The more that people ate legumes, nuts, seaweed, fruits, and dairy products, and the less they consumed red meat or processed meat and sweetened sodas, the longer their telomeres in their white blood cells.

*Homemade Trail Mix*

Combine:
* 1 Cup walnuts
* 1/2 cup cacao nibs/chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup goji berries

Seaweed is also good

# Part 4: The social world shapes your telomeres

## Chapter 11: The Places and Faces that support our telomeres

Communities where people do not trust one another, and where they fear violence, are damaging to telomere health.

Feeling stuck in your neighborhood—wanting to move but not having the money or opportunity to do so—is also linked to shorter telomeres

Children who live in a neighborhood that is physically disorderly, with vacant buildings and trash in the streets, have shorter telomeres. The presence of litter or broken glass right outside the house is an especially strong predictor of telomere trouble

The more education, the longer the telomeres.

**Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**: By-products of combustion and can be breathed in from fumes from cigarette and tobacco smoke, coal and coal tar, gas stoves, wildfires, hazardous waste, asphalt, and traffic pollution. You can also be exposed to PAHs if you eat foods grown in affected soil or that have been cooked on a grill

Have your water tested or use a filter. Avoid plastic drinking bottles and cookware. 

Don't microwave plastic

Good friends are like the trusted night watchmen; when they’re around, your telomeres are more protected

Having mixed-quality relationships is related to shorter telomeres.

Sexual intimacy in marriage accounts for longer telomeres.

**Renewal Lab**

Show gratitude and appreciation. Say, “Thanks for doing the dishes” or “Thanks for supporting me at the meeting.”

Acknowledge people you pass on the street.

## Chapter 12: Cellular aging begins in the womb

PARENTS CAN PASS THEIR SHORTENED TELOMERES TO THEIR CHILDREN

Babies whose mothers never completed high school have shorter telomeres in their cord blood compared to those whose moms had a high school diploma—meaning that they have shorter telomeres from the first day of their lives

Parents can directly transmit their telomere length to the child in the womb

Maternal malnourishment during pregnancy leads to increased risk of heart disease in the offspring.

Babies of mothers who have inadequate folate during pregnancy have shorter telomeres, further pointing to folate as vital for optimal telomere maintenance

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that pregnant women get between 400 and 800 micrograms of folate daily

when mothers experience severe stress and anxiety during pregnancy, their babies tend to have shorter telomeres in their cord blood.

## Chapter 13: How the early years shape telomeres

Early childhood neglect shortens telomeres—but there are interventions that can help neglected or traumatized children, if we can catch them at a young age

Children who had been exposed to the most violence had the greatest telomere shortening over the five years

Women who breast-feed their children can experience the rush of oxytocin in an intense, palpable way.

Children who’ve suffered from adversity are different. They may have a harder time regulating their emotions. They still need parents to be the emotional copilot—to reassure them that the parent has noticed their troubles and can be relied upon to help soothe them. They may need this reassurance over and over and over again. 

Teens tend to react to threat as a thrill; when they take risks, they feel good.

**Renewal Lab**

 No matter what a child’s situation or temperament, being connected to a screen means we’re not connected to the child.
 
Don’t let your teen’s emotional, thrill-seeking brain pull you into an escalating conflict. If your teen is ranting at you, you have options other than your automatic one… reacting.

When the parents showed affection to each other and the children felt more positive affect, the children tended to have longer telomeres. 

# Conclusion

Income inequality in regions and countries is associated with worse behavior (less trust, more violence, drug abuse) and worse health for all, whether it’s physical or mental health.

# The Telomere Effect by Eppel and Blackburn
## Notes by Christopher Durr

## Introduction

Why do people age at different rates?

Our healthspan is the number of years of our healthy life. Our diseasespan is the years we live with noticeable disease that interferes with our quality of living.

In some cases, lifestyle factors can turn genes on or shut them off. 

Telomeres, which shorten with each cell division, help determine how fast your cells age and when they die, depending on how quickly they wear down.

Senescent cells can leak proinflammatory substances that make you vulnerable to more pain, more chronic illness. Eventually, many senescent cells will undergo a preprogrammed death.

Age is by far the largest determinant of chronic diseases.

# Part 1: Telomeres, a pathway to living longer

1. How old do I look?
* I look younger than my age.
* I look about my age.
* I look older than my age.

2. How would I rate my physical health?
* I’m in better health than most people my age.
* I’m about as healthy as most people my age.
* I’m less healthy than most people my age.
3. How old do I feel?
* I feel younger than my age.
* I feel about my age.
* I feel older than my age.

Studies show that people who feel older than their biological age also tend to be sicker earlier than people who feel younger.

Some cells have a limit to how many times they can divide. When cells can no longer renew themselves, the body tissues they supply will start to age and function poorly.

Aging can be defined as the cell’s “progressive functional impairment and reduced capacity to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli and injuries.” 

A healthy level of bone density results when you have a balance between the bone-building cells (osteoblasts) and the bone-busting cells (osteoclasts).

Each strand of hair begins inside its own follicle and is made from keratin, which produces a white hair. But there are special cells inside the follicle—melanocytes, the same kinds of cells responsible for skin color—that inject the hair with pigment

Chronic inflammation is also a factor in heart disease, brain diseases, gum disease, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hepatitis, cancers, and more. That’s why scientists talk about inflamm-aging. It’s real.

Short telomeres may help cause Alzheimer’s directly.

When you catch yourself thinking of old age negatively, remind yourself of the positive side of aging

People with more emotional complexity also have a longer healthspan

If you think of aging in a positive way, odds are that you’ll live seven and a half years longer than someone who doesn’t, at least according to one study

## Chapter 2: The power of long telomeres

That variability in the lengths of the ends turns out to be one of the factors that explains why some of us live longer and healthier than others.

Tetrahymena (Pond Scum) provided the first precious information about telomeres, telomerase, and a cell’s life span.

Telomeres on average grew shorter and shorter as people progressed from their twenties, hitting rock bottom at around age seventy-five

People with the longest telomeres are the healthiest, and as telomeres get shorter, people get sicker and are more likely to die.
 
People with shorter telomeres are more likely to have a chronic disease, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, impaired immune function, and certain types of cancers
 
## Chapter 3: Telomerase, the Enzyme That Replenishes Telomeres

Telomerase creates new telomeres patterned on its own biochemical sequence. It can slow, prevent, or even reverse the shortening of telomeres that comes with cell division. 

Tetrahymena cells have telomerase in sufficient quantities so that they can constantly rebuild their telomeres. 

You may potentially increase the chance of developing any of a number of different cancers (such as melanomas or brain and lung cancers). Knowing this, it comes as no surprise that our cells keep their telomerase on a tight rein.

Some types of cancers are more likely to develop when too little available telomerase makes telomeres too short

It showed that the more stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres and the lower your telomerase levels.
 
# Part 2: Your cells are listening to your thoughts

## Chapter 4: How stress gets into your cells

Caregivers often feel unappreciated and become isolated. Health researchers have identified them as one of the most chronically stressed groups of people.

Short-term, manageable stressors can be good for you, because they build your coping muscles. You develop skills and confidence that you can handle challenges

Serious traumas, both recent and in childhood, have also been linked to damaged telomeres. These traumas include rape, abuse, domestic violence, and prolonged bullying.

The threat response causes your blood vessels to constrict so that you’ll bleed less if you’re wounded, but also less blood flows to your brain. 

Be hopeful. When you can’t control the difficult or stressful events in your life, you can still help protect your telomeres by shifting the way you view those events.

When researchers put people through lab stressors, the ones who are told to think of stress as useful are able to maintain their social equilibrium. 
Instead of looking away, playing with their hair, or fidgeting—all signs of feeling somewhat threatened—the challenge participants make direct eye contact. Their shoulders are relaxed, and their bodies move fluidly. They feel less anxiety and shame.
All these benefits happened simply because people were told to think of their stress as good for them.

T-cells look for cells that are either infected or cancerous

Exposing immune cells to the stress hormone cortisol dampens their levels of telomerase

Your telomeres don’t sweat the small stuff. Toxic stress, on the other hand, is something to watch for. Toxic stress is severe stress that lasts for years. Toxic stress can dampen down telomerase and shorten telomeres.

**Tips for reducing stress**

Think about an upcoming stressful task using the third person

The next time a threat looms, pause and list what’s most important to you. 

Next time you are in the grip of a stressful event, ask yourself, *In ten years, will this event still have an impact on me?*
